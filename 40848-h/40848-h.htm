<h3>A TRUE COLONIAL STORY.</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class ="smcap">Broadhurst's</span> store was closed, but the little
back room looked very comfortable that night.
The fire cast a ruddy glow on ceiling and walls,
reflecting itself cheerily on the polished flasks
and shot-guns which adorned them. Yet a gloom
rested on the two men who sat at either side of
the hearth, which neither the fire nor the black
bottle upon the table could alleviate.</p>

<p>"Twelve o'clock," said old Tom, the storeman
glancing up at the wooden timepiece which had
come out with him in '42. "It's a queer thing,
George, they haven't come."</p>

<p>"It's a dirty night," said his companion, reaching
out his arm for a plug of tobacco. "The
Wawirra's in flood, maybe; or maybe their horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
is broke down; or they've put it off, perhaps.
Great Lord, how it thunders! Pass us over a
coal, Tom."</p>

<p>He spoke in a tone which was meant to appear
easy, but with a painful thrill in it which was not
lost upon his mate. He glanced uneasily at him
from under his grizzled eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You think it's all right, George?" he said,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"Think what's all right?"</p>

<p>"Why, that the lads are safe."</p>

<p>"Safe! Of course they're safe. What the devil
is to harm them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing; nothing, to be sure," said old
Tom. "You see, George, since the old woman
died, Maurice has been all to me; and it makes
me kinder anxious. It's a week since they started
from the mine, and you'd ha' thought they'd be
here now. But it's nothing unusual, I s'pose;
nothing at all. Just my darned folly."</p>

<p>"What's to harm them?" repeated George
Hutton again, arguing to convince himself rather
than his comrade. "It's a straight road from the
diggin's to Rathurst, and then through the hills
past Bluemansdyke, and over the Wawirra by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
ford, and so down to Trafalgar by the bush track.
There's nothin' deadly in all that, is there? My
son Allan's as dear to me as Maurice can be to
you, mate," he continued; "but they know the
ford well, and there's no other bad place. They'll
be here to-morrow night, certain."</p>

<p>"Please God they may!" said Broadhurst; and
the two men lapsed into silence for some time,
moodily staring into the glow of the fire, and
pulling at their short clays.</p>

<p>It was indeed, as Hutton had said, a dirty
night. The wind was howling down through the
gorges of the western mountains, and whirling and
eddying among the streets of Trafalgar; whistling
through the chinks in the rough wood cabins,
and tearing away the frail shingles which formed
the roofs. The streets were deserted, save for one
or two stragglers from the drinking shanties, who
wrapped their cloaks around them and staggered
home through the wind and rain towards their
own cabins.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by Broadhurst, who was
evidently still ill at ease.</p>

<p>"Say, George," he said, "what's become of
Josiah Mapleton?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Went to the diggin's."</p>

<p>"Ay; but he sent word he was coming back."</p>

<p>"But he never came."</p>

<p>"An' what's become of Jos Humphrey?" he
resumed, after a pause.</p>

<p>"He went diggin', too."</p>

<p>"Well, did he come back?"</p>

<p>"Drop it, Broadhurst; drop it, I say," said
Hutton, springing to his feet and pacing up and
down the narrow room. "You're trying to make
a coward of me! You know the men must have
gone up country prospectin' or farmin', maybe.
What is it to us where they went? You don't
think I have a register of every man in the
colony, as Inspector Burton has of the lags."</p>

<p>"Sit down, George, and listen," said old Tom.
"There's something queer about that road; something
I don't understand, and don't like. Maybe
you remember how Maloney, the one-eyed scoundrel,
made his money in the early mining days.
He'd a half-way drinking shanty on the main
road up on a kind of bluff, where the Lena
comes down from the hills. You've heard, George,
how they found a sort of wooden slide from his
little back room down to the river; an' how it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
came out that man after man had had his drink
doctored, and been shot down that into eternity,
like a bale of goods. No one will ever know
how many were done away with there. <i>They</i>
were all supposed to be farmin' and prospectin',
and the like, till their bodies were picked out of
the rapids. It's no use mincing matters, George;
we'll have the troopers along to the diggin's if
those lads don't turn up by to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"As you like, Tom," said Hutton.</p>

<p>"By the way, talking of Maloney&mdash;it's a strange
thing," said Broadhurst, "that Jack Haldane
swears he saw a man as like Maloney with ten
years added to him as could be. It was in the
bush on Monday morning. Chance, I suppose;
but you'd hardly think there could be two pair
of shoulders in the world carrying such villainous
mugs on the top of them."</p>

<p>"Jack Haldane's a fool," growled Hutton, throwing
open the door and peering anxiously out into
the darkness, while the wind played with his long
grizzled beard, and sent a train of glowing sparks
from his pipe down the street.</p>

<p>"A terrible night!" he said, as he turned back
towards the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, a wild, tempestuous night; a night for birds
of darkness and for beasts of prey. A strange
night for seven men to lie out in the gully at
Bluemansdyke, with revolvers in their hands, and
the devil in their hearts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sun was rising after the storm. A thick,
heavy steam reeked up from the saturated ground,
and hung like a pall over the flourishing little
town of Trafalgar. A bluish mist lay in wreaths
over the wide track of bushland around, out of
which the western mountains loomed like great
islands in a sea of vapour.</p>

<p>Something was wrong in the town. The most
casual glance would have detected that. There
was a shouting and a hurrying of feet. Doors
were slammed and rude windows thrown open.
A trooper of police came clattering down with
his carbine unslung. It was past the time for
Joe Buchan's saw-mill to commence work, but
the great wheel was motionless, for the hands had
not appeared.</p>

<p>There was a surging, pushing crowd in the
main street before old Tom Broadhurst's house,
and a mighty clattering of tongues. "What was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
it?" demanded the new-comers, panting and
breathless. "Broadhurst has shot his mate."
"He has cut his own throat." "He has struck
gold in the clay floor of his kitchen." "No; it
was his son Maurice who had come home rich."
"Who had not come back at all." "Whose horse
had come back without him." At last the truth
had come out; and there was the old sorrel horse
in question whinnying and rubbing his neck
against the familiar door of the stable, as if
entreating entrance; while two haggard, grey-haired
men held him by either bridle, and gazed
blankly at his reeking sides.</p>

<p>"God help me," said old Tom Broadhurst; "it is
as I feared!"</p>

<p>"Cheer up, mate," said Hutton, drawing his rough
straw hat down over his brow. "There's hope yet."</p>

<p>A sympathetic and encouraging murmur ran
through the crowd.</p>

<p>"Horse ran away, likely."</p>

<p>"Or been stolen."</p>

<p>"Or he's swum the Wawirra an' been washed
off," suggested one Job's comforter.</p>

<p>"He ain't got no marks of bruising," said
another, more hopeful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rider fallen off drunk, maybe," said a bluff old
sheep-farmer. "I kin remember," he continued,
"coming into town 'bout this hour myself, with my
head in my holster, an' thinking I was a six-chambered
revolver&mdash;mighty drunk I was."</p>

<p>"Maurice had a good seat; he'd never be washed
off."</p>

<p>"Not he."</p>

<p>"The horse has a weal on its off fore-quarter,"
remarked another, more observant than the rest.</p>

<p>"A blow from a whip, maybe."</p>

<p>"It would be a darned hard one."</p>

<p>"Where's Chicago Bill?" said someone; "he'll
know."</p>

<p>Thus invoked, a strange, gaunt figure stepped
out in front of the crowd. He was an extremely
tall and powerful man, with the red shirt and high
boots of a miner. The shirt was thrown open,
showing the sinewy throat and massive chest. His
face was seamed and scarred with many a conflict,
both with Nature and his brother man; yet
beneath his ruffianly exterior there lay something
of the quiet dignity of the gentleman. This man
was a veteran gold-hunter; a real old Californian
'forty-niner, who had left the fields in disgust when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
private enterprise began to dwindle before the
formation of huge incorporated companies with
their ponderous machinery. But the red clay with
the little shining points had become to him as the
very breath of his nostrils, and he had come half-way
round the world to seek it once again.</p>

<p>"Here's Chicago Bill," he said; "what is it?"</p>

<p>Bill was naturally regarded as an oracle, in
virtue of his prowess and varied experience.
Every eye was turned on him as Braxton, the
young Irish trooper of constabulary, said, "What
do you make of the horse, Bill?"</p>

<p>The Yankee was in no hurry to commit himself.
He surveyed the animal for some time with his
shrewd little grey eye. He bent and examined
the girths; then he felt the mane carefully. He
stooped once more and examined the hoofs and
then the quarters. His eye rested on the blue
wheal already mentioned. This seemed to put him
on a scent, for he gave a long, low whistle, and
proceeded at once to examine the hair on either
side of the saddle. He saw something conclusive
apparently, for, with a sidelong glance under his
shaggy eyebrows at the two old men beside him,
he turned and fell back among the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what d'ye think?" cried a dozen voices.</p>

<p>"A job for you," said Bill, looking up at the
young Irish trooper.</p>

<p>"Why, what is it? What's become of young
Broadhurst?"</p>

<p>"He's done what better men has done afore.
He has sunk a shaft for gold and panned out a
coffin."</p>

<p>"Speak out, man! what have you seen?" cried
a husky voice.</p>

<p>"I've seen the graze of a bushranger's bullet on
the horse's quarter, an' I've seen a drop of the
rider's blood on the edge of the saddle&mdash;Here,
hold the old man up, boys; don't let him drop.
Give him a swig of brandy an' lead him inside.
Say," he continued, in a whisper, gripping the
trooper by the wrist, "mind, I'm in it. You an' I
play this hand together. I'm dead on sich varmin.
We'll do as they do in Nevada, strike while the
iron is hot. Get any men you can together. I
s'pose you're game to come yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come," said young Braxton, with a
quiet smile.</p>

<p>The American looked at him approvingly. He
had learned in his wanderings that an Irishman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
who grows quieter when deeply stirred is a very
dangerous specimen of the genus <i>homo</i>.</p>

<p>"Good lad!" he muttered; and the two went
down the street together towards the station-house,
followed by half-a-dozen of the more resolute of
the crowd.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One word before we proceed with our story, or
our chronicle rather, as every word of it is based
upon fact. The colonial trooper of fifteen or twenty
years ago was a very different man from his
representative of to-day. Not that I would imply
any slur upon the courage of the latter; but for
reckless dare-devilry and knight-errantry the old
constabulary has never been equalled. The reason
is a simple one. Men of gentle blood, younger
sons and wild rakes who had outrun the constable,
were sent off to Australia with some wild idea of
making their fortunes. On arriving they found
Melbourne by no means the El Dorado they
expected; they were unfit for any employment,
their money was soon dissipated, and they unerringly
gravitated into the mounted police. Thus a
sort of colonial "Maison Rouge" became formed,
where the lowest private had as much pride of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
birth and education as his officers. They were
men who might have swayed the fate of empires,
yet who squandered away their lives in many a
lone wild fight with native and bushranger, where
nothing but a mouldering blue-ragged skeleton was
left to tell the tale.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a glorious sunset. The whole western
sky was a blaze of flame, throwing a purple tint
upon the mountains, and gilding the sombre edges
of the great forest which spreads between Trafalgar
and the river Wawirra. It stretched out, a primeval,
unbroken wilderness, save at the one point where
a rough track had been formed by the miners and
their numerous camp-followers. This wound amid
the great trunks in a zigzag direction, occasionally
making a long detour to avoid some marshy hollow
or especially dense clump of vegetation. Often
it could be hardly discerned from the ground
around save by the scattered hoof-marks and an
occasional rut.</p>

<p>About fifteen miles from Trafalgar there stands
a little knoll, well sheltered and overlooking the
road. On this knoll a man was lying as the sun
went down that Friday evening. He appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
shun observation, for he had chosen that part in
which the foliage was thickest; yet he seemed
decidedly at his ease, as he lolled upon his back
with his pipe between his teeth, and a broad hat
down over his face. It was a face that it was well
to cover in the presence of so peaceful a scene&mdash;a
face pitted with the scars of an immaterial smallpox.
The forehead was broad and low; one eye
had apparently been gouged out, leaving a ghastly
cavity; the other was deep-set, cunning, and
vindictive. The mouth was hard and cruel; a
rough beard covered the chin. It was the cut of
face which, seen in a lonely street, would instinctively
make one shift the grasp of one's stick from
the knob end to the ferrule&mdash;the face of a bold and
unscrupulous man.</p>

<p>Some unpleasing thought seemed to occur to
him, for he rose with a curse and knocked the
ashes out of his pipe. "A darned fine thing," he
muttered, "that I should have to lie out like
this! It was Barrett's fault the job wasn't a
clean one, an' now he picks me out to get the
swamp-fever. If he'd shot the horse as I did
the man, we wouldn't need a watch on this
side of the Wawirra. He always was a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
white-livered cuss. Well," he continued, picking
up a gun which lay in the grass behind
him, "there's no use my waiting longer; they
wouldn't start during the night. Maybe the
horse never got home, maybe they gave them
up as drowned; anyhow it's another man's turn
to-morrow, so I'll just give them five minutes
and then make tracks." He sat down on the
stump of a tree as he spoke and hummed the
verse of a song. A sudden thought seemed to
strike him, for he plunged his hand into his
pocket, and after some searching extracted a
pack of playing cards wrapped in a piece of
dirty brown paper. He gazed earnestly at their
greasy faces for some time. Then he took a
pin from his sleeve and pricked a small hole in
the corner of each ace and knave. He chuckled
as he shuffled them up, and replaced them in
his pocket. "I'll have my share of the swag,"
he growled. "They're sharp, but they'll not
spot that when the liquor is in them. By the
Lord, here they are!"</p>

<p>He had sprung to his feet and was bending
to the ground, holding his breath as he listened.
To the unpractised ear all was as still as before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>&mdash;the
hum of a passing insect, the chirp of a bird,
the rustle of the leaves; but the bushranger
rose with the air of a man who has satisfied
himself. "Good-bye to Bluemansdyke," said he;
"I reckon it will be too hot to hold us for a
time. That thundering idiot! he's spoilt as nice
a lay as ever was, an' risked our necks into the
bargain. I'll see their number an' who they are,
though," he continued; and, choosing a point
where a rough thicket formed an effectual screen,
he coiled himself up, and lay like some venomous
snake, occasionally raising his head and peering
between the trunks at the reddish streak which
marked the Trafalgar Road.</p>

<p>There could be no question now as to the
approach of a body of horsemen. By the time
our friend was fairly ensconced in his hiding-place
the sound of voices and the clatter of hoofs was
distinctly audible, and in another moment a troop
of mounted men came sweeping round the curve
of the road. They were eleven all told, armed
to the teeth, and evidently well on the alert.
Two rode in front with rifles unslung, leisurely
scanning every bush which might shelter an
enemy. The main body kept about fifty yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
behind them, while a solitary horseman brought
up the rear. The ranger scanned them narrowly
as they passed. He seemed to recognise most
of them. Some were his natural enemies the
troopers; the majority were miners who had
volunteered to get rid of an evil which affected
their interests so closely. They were a fine
bronzed set of men, with a deliberate air about
them, as if they had come for a purpose and
meant to attain it. As the last rider passed before
his hiding-place the solitary watcher started and
growled a curse in his beard. "I know his
darned face," he said; "it's Bill Hanker, the man
who got the drop on Long Nat Smeaton in
Silver City in '53; what the thunder brought
him here? I must be off by the back track,
though, an' let the boys know." So saying, he
picked up his gun, and with a scowl after the
distant party, he crouched down and passed
rapidly and silently out of sight into the very
thickest part of the bush.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The expedition had started from Trafalgar on
the afternoon of the same day that Maurice
Broadhurst's horse, foam-flecked and frightened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
had galloped up to the old stable-door. Burton,
the inspector of constabulary, an energetic and
able man, as all who knew him can testify, was
in command. He had detached Braxton, the
young Irishman, and Thompson, another trooper,
as a vanguard. He himself rode with the main
body, grey-whiskered and lean, but as straight in
the back as when he and I built a shanty in '39
in what is now Burke Street, Melbourne. With
him were McGillivray, Foley, and Anson of the
Trafalgar force, Hartley the sheep-farmer, Murdoch
and Summerville, who had made their pile
at the mines, and Dan Murphy, who was cleaned
out when the clay of the "Orient" turned to
gravel, and had been yearning for a solid square
fight ever since. Chicago Bill formed the rear-guard,
and the whole party presented an appearance
which, though far from military, was
decidedly warlike.</p>

<p>They camped out that night seventeen miles
from Trafalgar, and next day pushed on as far
as where the Stirling Road runs across. The
third morning brought them to the northern
bank of the Wawirra, which they forded. Here
a council of war was held, for they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
entering what they regarded as enemy's country.
The bush track, though wild, was occasionally
traversed both by shepherds and sportsmen. It
would hardly be the home of a gang of desperate
bushrangers. But beyond the Wawirra the great
rugged range of the Tápu mountains towered up
to the clouds, and across a wild spur of these
the mining track passed up to Bluemansdyke.
It was here they decided at the council that the
scene of the late drama lay. The question now
was what means were to be taken to attack the
murderers; for that murder had been done no
man doubted.</p>

<p>All were of one mind as to what the main
line of action should be. To go for them
straight, shoot as many as possible on sight,
and hang the balance in Trafalgar: that was
plain sailing. But how to get at them was the
subject of much debate. The troopers were for
pushing on at once, and trusting to Fortune to
put the rangers in their way. The miners proposed
rather to gain some neighbouring peak,
from which a good view of the country could be
obtained, and some idea gained of their whereabouts.
Chicago Bill took rather a gloomy view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of things. "Nary one will we see," said he;
"they've dusted out of the district 'fore this.
They'd know the horse would go home, and
likely as not they've had a watch on the road
to warn them. I guess, boys, we'd best move
on an' do our best." There was some discussion,
but Chicago's opinion carried the day, and the
expedition pushed on in a body.</p>

<p>After passing the second upland station the
scenery becomes more and more grand and rugged.
Great peaks two and three thousand feet high rose
sheer up at each side of the narrow track. The
heavy wind and rain of the storm had brought
down much <i>débris</i>, and the road was almost impassable
in places. They were frequently compelled
to dismount and to lead the horses. "We
haven't far now, boys," said the inspector cheerily,
as they struggled on; and he pointed to a great
dark cleft which yawned in front of them between
two almost perpendicular cliffs. "They are there,"
he said, "or nowhere." A little higher the road
became better and their progress was more rapid.
A halt was called, guns were unslung, and their
pistols loosened in their belts, for the great gully of
Bluemansdyke&mdash;the wildest part of the whole Tápu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
range&mdash;was gaping before them. But not a thing
was to be seen; all was as still as the grave. The
horses were picketed in a quiet little ravine, and
the whole party crept on on foot. The Southern
sun glared down hot and clear on the yellow
bracken and banks of fern which lined the narrow
winding track. Still not a sign of life. Then
came a clear low whistle from the two advanced
troopers, announcing that something had been
discovered, and the main body hurried up. It was
a spot for deeds of blood. On one side of the
road there lowered a black gnarled precipice, on
the other was the sullen mouth of the rugged gully.
The road took a sharp turn at this spot. Just at
the angle several large boulders were scattered,
lining and overlooking the track. It was at this
angle that a little bed of mud and trampled red
clay betokened a recent struggle. There could be
no question that they were at the scene of the
murder of the two young miners. The outline of
a horse could still be seen in the soft ground, and
the prints of its hoofs as it kicked out in its death-agony
were plainly marked. Behind one of the
rocks were the tracks of several feet, and some
pistol wadding was found in a tuft of ferns. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
whole tragedy lay unclosed before them. Two
men, careless in the pride of their youth and their
strength, had swept round that fatal curve. Then
a crash, a groan, a brutal laugh, the galloping of a
frightened horse, and all was over.</p>

<p>What was to be done now? The rocks around
were explored, but nothing fresh discovered. Some
six days had elapsed, and the birds were apparently
flown. The party separated and hunted about
among the boulders. Then the American, who
could follow a trail like a bloodhound, found tracks
leading towards a rugged pile of rocks on the
north side of the gully. In a crevice here the
remains of three horses were found. Close to
them the rim of an old straw hat projected through
the loose loam. Hartley, the sheep-farmer, sprang
over to pick it up; he started back in the act of
stooping, and said in an awe-struck whisper to his
friend Murphy, "There's a head under it, Dan!"
A few strokes of a spade disclosed a face familiar
to most of the group&mdash;that of a poor travelling photographer
well known in the colony by the <i>sobriquet</i>
of "Stooping Johnny," who had disappeared some
time before. It was now in an advanced stage of
putrefaction. Close to him another body was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
discovered, and another beside that. In all, thirteen
victims of these English Thugs were lying under
the shadow of the great north wall of the Bluemansdyke
gully. It was there, standing in silent
awe round the remains of these poor fellows, hurried
into eternity and buried like dogs, that the search-party
registered a vow to sacrifice all interests and
comforts for the space of one month to the single
consideration of revenge. The inspector uncovered
his grizzled head as he solemnly swore it, and his
comrades followed his example. The bodies
were then, with a brief prayer, consigned to a
deeper grave, a rough cairn was erected over them,
and the eleven men set forth upon their mission of
stern justice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three weeks had passed&mdash;three weeks and two
days. The sun was sinking over the great waste
of bushland, unexplored and unknown, which
stretches away from the eastern slope of the Tápu
mountains. Save some eccentric sportsman or
bold prospector, no colonist had ever ventured into
that desolate land; yet on this autumn evening
two men were standing in a little glade in the very
heart of it. They were engaged tying up their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
horses, and apparently making preparations for
camping out for the night. Though haggard,
unkempt, and worn, one still might recognise two
of our former acquaintances&mdash;the young Irish
trooper and the American Chicago Bill.</p>

<p>This was the last effort of the avenging party.
They had traversed the mountain gorges, they had
explored every gully and ravine, and now they had
split into several small bands, and, having named
a trysting-place, they were scouring the country in
the hope of hitting upon some trace of the murderers.
Foley and Anson had remained among
the hills, Murdoch and Dan Murphy were exploring
towards Rathurst, Summerville and the inspector
had ascended along the Wawirra, while the
others in three parties were wandering through the
eastern bushland.</p>

<p>Both the trooper and the miner seemed dejected
and weary. The one had set out with visions of
glory, and hopes of a short cut to the coveted
stripes which would put him above his fellows;
the other had obeyed a rough wild sense of justice;
and each was alike disappointed. The horses were
picketed, and the men threw themselves heavily
upon the ground. There was no need to light a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
fire; a few dampers and some rusty bacon were
their whole provisions. Braxton produced them,
and handed his share to his comrade. They ate
their rough meal without a word. Braxton was
the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>"We're playing our last card," he said.</p>

<p>"And a darned poor one at that," replied his
comrade.</p>

<p>"Why, mate," he continued, "if we did knock
up agin these all-fired varmin, ye don't suppose
you and I would go for them? I guess I'd up an'
shove for Trafalgar first."</p>

<p>Braxton smiled. Chicago's reckless courage
was too well known in the colony for any words of
his to throw a doubt upon it. Miners still tell how,
during the first great rush in '52, a blustering
ruffian, relying upon some similar remark of the
pioneer's, had tried to establish a reputation by an
unprovoked assault upon him; and the narrators
then glide imperceptibly into an account of Bill's
handsome conduct towards the widow&mdash;how he
had given her his week's clean-up to start her in a
drinking shanty. Braxton thought of this as he
smiled at Chicago's remarks, and glanced at the
massive limbs and weather-beaten face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'd best see where we are before it grows
darker," he said; and rising, he stacked his gun
against the trunk of a blue gum-tree, and seizing
some of the creepers which hung down from it,
began rapidly and silently to ascend it.</p>

<p>"His soul's too big for his body," growled the
American, as he watched the dark lithe figure
standing out against the pale-blue evening sky.</p>

<p>"What d'ye see, Jack?" he shouted; for the
trooper had reached the topmost branch by this
time, and was taking a survey of the country.</p>

<p>"Bush, bush; nothing but bush," said the voice
among the leaves. "Wait a bit, though; there's a
kind of hill about three miles off away to the nor'-east.
I see it above the trees right over there.
Not much good to us, though," he continued, after
a pause, "for it seems a barren, stony sort of
place."</p>

<p>Chicago paced about at the bottom of the tree.</p>

<p>"He seems an almighty long time prospectin'
it," he muttered, after ten minutes had elapsed.
"Ah, here he is!" and the trooper came swinging
down and landed panting just in front of him.</p>

<p>"Why, what's come over him? What's the
matter, Jack?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Something was the matter. That was very
evident. There was a light in Braxton's blue eyes,
and a flush on the pale cheek.</p>

<p>"Bill," he said, putting his hand on his comrade's
shoulder, "it's about time you made tracks for the
settlements."</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean?" said Chicago.</p>

<p>"Why, I mean that the murderers are within a
league of us, and that I intend going for them.
There, don't be huffed, old man," he added; "of
course I knew you were only joking. But they
are there, Bill; I saw smoke on the top of that hill,
and it wasn't good, honest smoke, mind you; it
was dry-wood smoke, and meant to be hid. I
thought it was mist at first; but no, it was smoke.
I'll swear it. It could only be them: who else
would camp on the summit of a desolate hill?
We've got them, Bill; we have them as sure as
Fate."</p>

<p>"Or they've got us," growled the American.
"But here, lad, here's my glass; run up and have
a look at them."</p>

<p>"It's too dark now," said Braxton; "we'll camp
out to-night. No fear of them stirring. They're
lying by there until the whole thing blows over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
depend upon it; so we'll make sure of them in the
morning."</p>

<p>The miner looked plaintively up at the tree,
and then down at his fourteen stone of solid
muscle.</p>

<p>"I guess I must take your word for it," he
grumbled; "but you are bushman enough to tell
smoke from mist, and a dry-wood fire from an
open one. We can't do anything to-night till we
feel our way, so I allow we'd best water the horses
an' have a good night's rest."</p>

<p>Braxton seemed to be of the same mind; so
after a few minutes' preparation the two men
wrapped themselves in their cloaks, and lay, two
little dark spots, on the great green carpet of the
primeval bush.</p>

<p>With the first grey light of dawn Chicago sat up
and roused his comrade. A heavy mist bung over
the bushland. They could hardly see the loom of
the trees across the little glade. Their clothes
glistened with the little shining beads of moisture.
They brushed each other down, and squatted in
bush fashion over their rough breakfast. The haze
seemed to be lifting a little now; they could see
fifty yards in every direction. The miner paced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
up and down in silence, ruminating over a plug of
"Barrett's twist." Braxton sat on a fallen tree
sponging and oiling his revolver. Suddenly a
single beam of sunshine played over the great blue
gum. It widened and spread, and then in a
moment the mist melted away, and the yellow
leaves glowed like flakes of copper in the glare of
the morning sun. Braxton cheerily snapped the
lock of the pistol, loaded it, and replaced it in his
belt. Chicago began to whistle, and stopped in
the middle of his walk.</p>

<p>"Now, young un," he said, "here's the glass."</p>

<p>Braxton slung it round his neck, and ascended
the tree as he had done the night before. It was
child's-play to the trooper&mdash;a splendid climber, as
I can testify; for I saw him two years later swarming
up the topmost backstay of the <i>Hector</i> frigate
in a gale of wind for a bet of a bottle of wine. He
soon reached the summit, and shuffling along a
naked branch two hundred feet from the ground,
he gained a point where no leaves could obstruct
his view. Here he sat straddle-legged; and, unslinging
the glass, he proceeded to examine the
hill, bush by bush and stone by stone.</p>

<p>An hour passed without his moving. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
had almost elapsed before he descended. His
face was grave and thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Are they there?" was the eager query.</p>

<p>"Yes; they are there."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"I've only seen five; but there may be more.
Wait till I think it out, Bill."</p>

<p>The miner gazed at him with all the reverence
matter has towards mind. Thinking things out
was not his strong point.</p>

<p>"Blamed if I can help you," he said apologetically.
"It kinder don't come nat'ral to me to be
plottin' and plannin'. Want o' eddication, likely.
My father was allowed to be the hardest-headed
man in the States. Judge Jeffers let on as how the
old man wanted to hand in his checks; so he down
an' put his head on the line when the first engine
as ran from Vermont was comin' up. They fined
him a hundred dollars for upsettin' that 'ere locomotive;
an' the old man got the cussedest headache
as ever was."</p>

<p>Braxton hardly seemed to hear this family anecdote;
he was deep in thought.</p>

<p>"Look here, old man," said he; "sit down by me
on the trunk and listen to what I say. Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
that you are here as a volunteer, Bill&mdash;you've no
call to come; now, I am here in the course of duty.
Your name is known through the settlement; you
were a marked man when I was in the nursery.
Now, Bill, it's a big thing I am going to ask you.
If you and I go in and take these men, it will be
another feather in your cap, and in yours only.
What do men know of Jack Braxton, the private
of police? He'd hardly be mentioned in the
matter. Now, I want to make my name this day.
We'll have to secure these men by a surprise after
dusk, and it will be as easy for one resolute man to
do it as for two; perhaps easier, for there is less
chance of detection. Bill, I want you to stay with
the horses, and let me go alone."</p>

<p>Chicago sprang to his feet with a snarl of indignation,
and paced up and down in front of the
fallen trees. Then he seemed to master himself,
for he sat down again.</p>

<p>"They'd chaw you up, lad," he said, putting his
hand on Braxton's shoulder. "It wouldn't wash."</p>

<p>"Not they," said the trooper. "I'd take your
pistol as well as my own, and I'd need a deal of
chawing."</p>

<p>"My character would be ruined," said Bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's beyond the reach of calumny. You can
afford to give me one fair chance."</p>

<p>Bill buried his face in his hands, and thought a
little.</p>

<p>"Well, lad," he said, looking up, "I'll look after
the horses."</p>

<p>Braxton wrung him by the hand. "There are
few men would have done it, Bill; you are a friend
worth having. Now, we'll spend our day as best
we can, old man, and lie close till evening; for I
won't start till an hour after dusk; so we have
plenty of time on our hands."</p>

<p>The day passed slowly. The trooper lay among
the mosses below the great blue gum in earnest
thought. Once or twice he imagined he heard the
subterranean chuckle and slap of the thigh which
usually denoted amusement on the part of the
miner; but on glancing up at that individual, the
expression of his face was so solemn, not to say
funereal, that it was evidently an illusion. They
partook of their scanty dinner and supper cheerfully
and with hearty appetites. The former
listlessness had given place to briskness and
activity, now that their object was in view. Chicago
blossomed out into many strange experiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and racy reminiscences of Western life. The
hours passed rapidly and cheerily. The trooper
produced a venerable pack of cards from his holster
and proposed euchre; but their gregariousness,
and the general difficulty of distinguishing the king
of clubs from the ace of hearts, exercised a
depressing influence upon the players. Gradually
the sun went down on the great wilderness. The
shadow fell on the little glade, while the distant hill
was still tipped with gold; then that too became
purplish, a star twinkled over the Tápu range, and
night crept over the scene.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, old man," said Braxton. "I won't
take my carbine; it would only be in the way. I
can't thank you enough for letting me have this
chance. If they wipe me out, Bill, you'll not lose
sight of them, I know; and you'll say I died like a
man. I've got no friends and no message, and
nothing in the world but this pack of cards. Keep
them, Bill; they were a fine pack in '51. If you
see a smoke on the hill in the morning you'll know
all's well, and you'll bring up the horses at once.
If you don't, you'll ride to Fallen Pine, where
we were to meet,&mdash;ride day and night, Bill,&mdash;tell
Inspector Burton that you know where the rangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
are, that Private Braxton is dead, and that he said
he was to bring up his men, else he'd come back
from the grave and lead them up himself. Do
that, Bill. Good-bye."</p>

<p>A great quiet rested over the heart of that
desolate woodland. The croak of a frog, the
gurgle of a little streamlet half hidden in the long
grass&mdash;no other sound. Then a wakeful jay gave
a shrill chatter, another joined, and another; a
bluefinch screamed; a wombat rushed past to gain
its burrow. Something had disturbed them; yet
all was apparently as peaceful as before. Had you
been by the jay's nest, however, and peered downwards,
you would have seen something gliding like
a serpent through the brushwood, and caught a
glimpse, perhaps, of a pale, resolute face, and the
glint of a pocket-compass pointing north-by-east.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a long and weary night for Trooper
Braxton. Any moment he might come on an
outpost of the rangers, so every step had to be
taken slowly and with care. But he was an
experienced woodman, and hardly a twig snapped
as he crawled along. A morass barred his progress,
and he was compelled to make a long detour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Then he found himself in thick brushwood, and
once more had to go out of his way. It was very
dark here in the depth of the forest. There was a
heavy smell, and a dense steam laden with miasma
rose from the ground. In the dim light he saw
strange creeping things around him. A bushmaster
writhed across the path in front of him, a
cold, dank lizard crawled over his hand as he
crouched down; but the trooper thought only of
the human reptiles in front, and made steadily for
his goal. Once he seemed to be pursued by some
animal; he heard a creaking behind him, but it
ceased when he stopped and listened, so he
continued his way.</p>

<p>It was when he reached the base of the hill
which he had seen from the distance that the real
difficulty of his undertaking began. It was almost
conical in shape, and very steep. The sides were
covered with loose stones and an occasional large
boulder. One false step here would send a shower
of these tell-tale fragments clattering down the hill.
The trooper stripped off his high leather boots and
turned up his trousers; then he began cautiously
to climb, cowering down behind every boulder.</p>

<p>There was a little patch of light far away on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
horizon, a very little grey patch, but it caused the
figure of a man who was moving upon the crest of
the hill to loom out dim and large. He was a
sentry apparently, for he carried a gun under his
arm. The top of the hill was formed by a little
plateau about a hundred yards in circumference.
Along the edge of this the man was pacing, occasionally
stopping to peer down into the great dusky
sea beneath him. From this raised edge the
plateau curved down from every side, so as to form
a crater-like depression. In the centre of this
hollow stood a large white tent. Several horses
were picketed around it, and the ground was
littered with bundles of dried grass and harness.
You could see these details now from the edge of
the plateau, for the grey patch in the east had
become white, and was getting longer and wider.
You could see the sentry's face, too, as he paced
round and round. A handsome, weak-minded face,
with more of the fool than the devil impressed on it.
He seemed cheerful, for the birds were beginning to
sing, and their thousand voices rose from the bush
below. He forgot the forged note, I think, and the
dreary voyage, and the wild escape, and the dark
gully away beyond the Tápu range; for his eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
glistened, and he hummed a quaint little Yorkshire
country air. He was back again in the West
Riding village, and the rough boulder in front
shaped itself into the hill behind which Nelly lived
before he broke her heart, and he saw the ivied
church that crowned it. He would have seen
something else had he looked again&mdash;something
which was not in his picture: a white passionless
face which glared at him over the boulder, as he
turned upon his heel, still singing, and unconscious
that the bloodhounds of justice were close at his
heels.</p>

<p>The trooper's time for action had come. He
had reached the last boulder; nothing lay between
the plateau and himself but a few loose stones.
He could hear the song of the sentry dying away
in the distance; he drew his regulation sword,
and, with his Adams in his left, he rose and sprang
like a tiger over the ridge and down into the
hollow.</p>

<p>The sentry was startled from his dream of the
past by a clatter and a rattling of stones. He
sprang round and cocked his gun. No wonder
that he gasped, and that a change passed over
his bronzed face. A painter would need a dash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of ultramarine in his flesh-tints to represent it
now. No wonder, I say; for that dark active
figure with the bare feet and the brass buttons
meant disgrace and the gallows to him. He saw
him spring across to the tent; he saw the gleam
of a sword, and heard a crash as the tent-pole
was severed, and the canvas came down with a
run upon the heads of the sleepers. And then
above oaths and shouts he heard a mellow Irish
voice&mdash;"I've twelve shots in my hands. I have
ye, every mother's son. Up with your arms! up,
I say, before there is blood upon my soul. One
move, and ye stand before the throne." Braxton
had stooped and parted the doorway of the fallen
tent, and was now standing over six ruffians who
occupied it. They lay as they had wakened, but
with their hands above their heads, for there was
no resisting that quiet voice, backed up by the
two black muzzles. They imagined they were
surrounded and hopelessly outmatched. Not one
of them dreamed that the whole attacking force
stood before them. It was the sentry who first
began to realise the true state of the case. There
was no sound or sign of any reinforcement. He
looked to see that the cap was pressed well down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
on the nipple, and crept towards the tent. He
was a good shot, as many a keeper on Braidagarth
and the Yorkshire fells could testify. He raised
his gun to his shoulder. Braxton heard the click,
but dared not remove his eye or his weapon from
his six prisoners. The sentry looked along the
sights. He knew his life depended upon that
shot. There was more of the devil than the fool
in his face now. He paused a moment to make
sure of his aim, and then came a crash and the
thud of a falling body. Braxton was still standing
over the prisoners, but the sentry's gun was
unfired, and he himself was writhing on the
ground with a bullet through his lungs. "Ye
see," said Chicago, as he rose from behind a
rock with his gun still smoking in his hand, "it
seemed a powerful mean thing to leave you,
Jack; so I thought as I'd kinder drop around
promiscus, and wade in if needed, which I was,
as you can't deny. No, ye don't," he added, as
the sentry stretched out his hand to grasp his
fallen gun; "leave the wepin alone, young man;
it ain't in your way as it lies there."</p>

<p>"I'm a dead man!" groaned the ranger.</p>

<p>"Then lie quiet like a respectable corpse,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
said the miner, "an' don't go a-squirmin' towards
yer gun. That's ornary uneddicated conduct."</p>

<p>"Come here, Bill," cried Braxton, "and bring
the ropes those horses are picketed with. Now,"
he continued, as the American, having abstracted
the sentry's gun, appeared with an armful of
ropes, "you tie these fellows up, and I'll kill any
man who moves."</p>

<p>"A pleasant division of labour, eh, old Blatherskite,"
said Chicago, playfully tapping the one-eyed
villain Maloney on the head. "Come on;
the ugliest first!" So saying, he began upon
him and fastened him securely.</p>

<p>One after another the rangers were tied up; all
except the wounded man, who was too helpless
to need securing. Then Chicago went down and
brought up the horses, while Braxton remained
on guard; and by mid-day the cavalcade was in
full march through the forest <i>en route</i> for Fallen
Pine, the rendezvous of the search-party. The
wounded man was tied on to a horse in front,
the other rangers followed on foot for safety, while
the trooper and Chicago brought up the rear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a sad assemblage at Fallen Pine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
One by one they had dropped in, tanned with
the sun, torn by briers, weakened by the poisonous
miasma of the marshlands, all with the same tale
of privation and failure. Summerville and the
inspector had fallen in with blacks above the
upper ford, and had barely escaped with their
lives. Troopers Foley and Anson were well,
though somewhat gaunt from privation. Hartley
had lost his horse from the bite of a bushmaster.
Murdoch and Murphy had scoured the bush as
far as Rathurst, but without success. All were
dejected and weary. They only waited the
arrival of two of their number to set out on
their return to Trafalgar.</p>

<p>It was mid-day, and the sun was beating down
with a pitiless glare on the little clearing. The
men were lying about on the shady side of the
trunks, some smoking, some with their hats over
their faces and half asleep. The horses were
tethered here and there, looking as listless as
their masters. Only the inspector's old charger
seemed superior to the weather&mdash;a shrewd, <i>blasé</i>
old horse, that had seen the world, and was
nearly as deeply versed in woodcraft as his master.
As Chicago said, "Short of climbin' a tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
there weren't nothin' that horse couldn't do; an'
it would make a darned good try at that if it
was pushed." Old "Sawback" seemed ill at ease
this afternoon. Twice he had pricked up his
ears, and once he had raised his head as if
to neigh, but paused before committing himself.
The inspector looked at him curiously and put
his meerschaum back into its case. Meerschaums
were always a weakness of poor Jim Burton's.
"Demme it, sir," I have heard him say, "a gentleman
is known by his pipe. When he comes
down in the world his pipe has most vitality."
He put the case inside his uniform and went
over to the horse. The ears were still twitching.</p>

<p>"He hears something," said the inspector. "By
Jove, so do I! Here, boys, jump up; there's a
body of men coming!" Every man sprang to
his horse's head. "I hear hoofs, and I hear the
tramp of men on foot. They must be a large
party. They're heading straight for us. Get
under cover, boys, and have your guns loose."
The men wheeled right and left, and in a very
few moments the glade was deserted. Only the
brown barrel of a gun here and there among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
long grass and the ferns showed where they were
crouching. "Steady, boys!" said Burton; "if
they are enemies, don't fire till I give the word.
Then one by one aim low, and let the smoke
clear. Rangers, by Jove!" he added, as a horseman
broke into the clearing some way down,
with his head hanging down over his horse's
neck. "More," he growled, as several men
emerged from the bush at the same point. "By
the living powers, they are taken! I see the
ropes. Hurrah!" And next moment Braxton
and Chicago were mobbed by nine shouting,
dancing men, who pulled them and tugged at
them, and slapped them on the back, and dragged
them about in such a way, that Maloney whispered
with a scowl&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we'd had the grit to do as much, we'd
have been free men this day!"</p>

<p>And now our story is nearly done. We have
chronicled a fact which we think is worthy of a
wider circulation than the colonial drinking-bar
and the sheep-farmer's fireside, for Trooper Braxton
and his capture of the Bluemansdyke murderers
have long been household words among
our brothers in the England of the Southern seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>We need not detail that joyful ride to Trafalgar,
nor the welcome, nor the attempt at lynching;
nor how Maloney, the arch criminal, turned
Queen's evidence, and so writhed away from the
gallows. All that may be read in the colonial
press more graphically than I can tell it. My
friend Jack Braxton is an officer now, as his
father was before him, and still in the Trafalgar
force. Bill I saw last in '61, when he came over
to London in charge of the barque of the <i>Wellingtonia</i>
for the International Exhibition. He is
laying on flesh, I fear, since he took to sheep-farming;
for he was barely brought up by seventeen
stone, and his fighting weight used to be
fourteen; but he looks well and hearty. Maloney
was lynched in Placerville&mdash;at least so I heard.
I had a letter last mail from the old inspector;
he has left the police, and has a farm at Rathurst.
I think, stout-hearted as he is, he must
give a little bit of a shudder when he rides down
to Trafalgar for the Thursday market, and comes
round that sharp turn of the road where the
boulders lie, and the furze looks so yellow against
the red clay.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PARSON_OF_JACKMANS_GULCH" id="THE_PARSON_OF_JACKMANS_GULCH"><i>THE PARSON OF JACKMAN'S GULCH.</i></a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class ="smcap">He</span> was known in the Gulch as the Reverend Elias
B. Hopkins, but it was generally understood that
the title was an honorary one, extorted by his
many eminent qualities, and not borne out by
any legal claim which he could adduce. "The
Parson" was another of his <i>sobriquets</i>, which was
sufficiently distinctive in a land where the flock
was scattered and the shepherds few. To do
him justice, he never pretended to have received
any preliminary training for the ministry or any
orthodox qualification to practise it. "We're all
working in the claim of the Lord," he remarked
one day, "and it don't matter a cent whether
we're hired for the job or whether we waltzes in
on our own account," a piece of rough imagery
which appealed directly to the instincts of Jackman's
Gulch. It is quite certain that during the
first few months his presence had a marked effect
in diminishing the excessive use both of strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
drinks and of stronger adjectives which had been
characteristic of the little mining settlement.
Under his tuition, men began to understand that
the resources of their native language were less
limited than they had supposed, and that it was
possible to convey their impressions with accuracy
without the aid of a gaudy halo of profanity.</p>

<p>We were certainly in need of a regenerator
at Jackman's Gulch about the beginning of '53.
Times were flush then over the whole colony, but
nowhere flusher than there. Our material prosperity
had had a bad effect upon our morals.
The camp was a small one, lying rather better
than a hundred and twenty miles to the south
of Ballarat, at a spot where a mountain torrent
finds its way down a rugged ravine on its way
to join the Arrowsmith River. History does not
relate who the original Jackman may have been,
but at the time I speak of the camp it contained a
hundred or so adults, many of whom were men
who had sought an asylum there after making
more civilised mining centres too hot to hold
them. They were a rough, murderous crew,
hardly leavened by the few respectable members
of society who were scattered among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Communication between Jackman's Gulch and
the outside world was difficult and uncertain. A
portion of the bush between it and Ballarat was
infested by a redoubtable outlaw named Conky
Jim, who, with a small gang as desperate as
himself, made travelling a dangerous matter. It
was customary, therefore, at the Gulch, to store
up the dust and nuggets obtained from the mines
in a special store, each man's share being placed
in a separate bag on which his name was marked.
A trusty man, named Woburn, was deputed to
watch over this primitive bank. When the amount
deposited became considerable, a waggon was
hired, and the whole treasure was conveyed to
Ballarat, guarded by the police and by a certain
number of miners, who took it in turn to perform
the office. Once in Ballarat, it was forwarded on
to Melbourne by the regular gold waggons. By
this plan, the gold was often kept for months in
the Gulch before being despatched, but Conky Jim
was effectually checkmated, as the escort party
were far too strong for him and his gang. He
appeared, at the time of which I write, to have
forsaken his haunts in disgust, and the road could
be traversed by small parties with impunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Comparative order used to reign during the
daytime at Jackman's Gulch, for the majority of
the inhabitants were out with crowbar and pick
among the quartz ledges, or washing clay and
sand in their cradles by the banks of the little
stream. As the sun sank down, however, the
claims were gradually deserted, and their unkempt
owners, clay-bespattered and shaggy, came lounging
into camp, ripe for any form of mischief.
Their first visit was to Woburn's gold store, where
their clean-up of the day was duly deposited, the
amount being entered in the store-keeper's book,
and each miner retaining enough to cover his
evening's expenses. After that all restraint was
at an end, and each set to work to get rid of his
surplus dust with the greatest rapidity possible.
The focus of dissipation was the rough bar, formed
by a couple of hogsheads spanned by planks,
which was dignified by the name of the "Britannia
drinking saloon." Here, Nat Adams, the burly
bar-keeper, dispensed bad whisky at the rate of
two shillings a noggin, or a guinea a bottle, while
his brother Ben acted as croupier in a rude wooden
shanty behind, which had been converted into a
gambling hell, and was crowded every night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
There had been a third brother, but an unfortunate
misunderstanding with a customer had shortened
his existence. "He was too soft to live long,"
his brother Nathaniel feelingly observed on the
occasion of his funeral. "Many's the time I've
said to him, 'If you're arguin' a pint with a
stranger, you should always draw first, then argue,
and then shoot, if you judge that he's on the
shoot.' Bill was too purlite. He must needs
argue first and draw after, when he might just as
well have kivered his man before talkin' it over
with him." This amiable weakness of the deceased
Bill was a blow to the firm of Adams, which
became so short-handed that the concern could
hardly be worked without the admission of a
partner, which would mean a considerable decrease
in the profits.</p>

<p>Nat Adams had had a roadside shanty in the
Gulch before the discovery of gold, and might,
therefore, claim to be the oldest inhabitant.
These keepers of shanties were a peculiar race,
and, at the cost of a digression, it may be interesting
to explain how they managed to amass considerable
sums of money in a land where travellers
were few and far between. It was the custom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the "bushmen," <i>i.e.</i> bullock drivers, sheep tenders,
and the other white hands who worked on the
sheep-runs up country, to sign articles by which
they agreed to serve their master for one, two, or
three years at so much per year and certain daily
rations. Liquor was never included in this agreement,
and the men remained, per force, total
abstainers during the whole time. The money
was paid in a lump sum at the end of the engagement.
When that day came round, Jimmy, the
stockman, would come slouching into his master's
office, cabbage-tree hat in hand.</p>

<p>"Morning, master!" Jimmy would say. "My
time's up. I guess I'll draw my cheque and ride
down to town."</p>

<p>"You'll come back, Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come back. Maybe I'll be away three
weeks, maybe a month. I want some clothes,
master, and my bloomin' boots are well-nigh off
my feet."</p>

<p>"How much, Jimmy?" asks his master, taking
up his pen.</p>

<p>"There's sixty pound screw," Jimmy answers
thoughtfully; "and you mind, master, last March,
when the brindled bull broke out o' the paddock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Two pound you promised me then. And a pound
at the dipping. And a pound when Millar's
sheep got mixed with ourn;" and so he goes
on, for bushmen can seldom write, but they have
memories which nothing escapes.</p>

<p>His master writes the cheque and hands it
across the table. "Don't get on the drink,
Jimmy," he says.</p>

<p>"No fear of that, master," and the stockman
slips the cheque into his leather pouch, and within
an hour he is ambling off upon his long-limbed
horse on his hundred mile journey to town.</p>

<p>Now Jimmy has to pass some six or eight of
the above-mentioned roadside shanties in his day's
ride, and experience has taught him that if he
once breaks his accustomed total abstinence, the
unwonted stimulant has an overpowering effect
upon his brain. Jimmy shakes his head warily as
he determines that no earthly consideration will
induce him to partake of any liquor until his
business is over. His only chance is to avoid
temptation; so, knowing that there is the first
of these houses some half mile ahead, he plunges
into a by-path through the bush which will lead
him out at the other side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy is riding resolutely along this narrow
path, congratulating himself upon a danger
escaped, when he becomes aware of a sunburned,
black-bearded man who is leaning unconcernedly
against a tree beside the track. This is none
other than the shanty-keeper, who, having observed
Jimmy's man&oelig;uvre in the distance, has
taken a short cut through the bush in order to
intercept him.</p>

<p>"Morning, Jimmy!" he cries, as the horseman
comes up to him.</p>

<p>"Morning, mate; morning!"</p>

<p>"Where are ye off to to-day then?"</p>

<p>"Off to town," says Jimmy sturdily.</p>

<p>"No, now&mdash;are you though? You'll have bully
times down there for a bit. Come round and have
a drink at my place. Just by way of luck."</p>

<p>"No," says Jimmy, "I don't want a drink."</p>

<p>"Just a little damp."</p>

<p>"I tell ye I don't want one," says the stockman
angrily.</p>

<p>"Well, ye needn't be so darned short about it.
It's nothin' to me whether you drinks or not.
Good mornin'."</p>

<p>"Good mornin'," says Jimmy, and has ridden on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
about twenty yards when he hears the other
calling on him to stop.</p>

<p>"See here, Jimmy!" he says, overtaking him
again. "If you'll do me a kindness when you're
up in town I'd be obliged."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a letter, Jim, as I wants posted. It's an
important one too, an' I wouldn't trust it with every
one; but I knows you, and if you'll take charge on
it it'll be a powerful weight off my mind."</p>

<p>"Give it here," Jimmy says laconically.</p>

<p>"I hain't got it here. It's round in my caboose.
Come round for it with me. It ain't more'n
quarter of a mile."</p>

<p>Jimmy consents reluctantly. When they reach
the tumble-down hut the keeper asks him cheerily
to dismount and to come in.</p>

<p>"Give me the letter," says Jimmy.</p>

<p>"It ain't altogether wrote yet, but you sit down
here for a minute and it'll be right," and so the
stockman is beguiled into the shanty.</p>

<p>At last the letter is ready and handed over.
"Now, Jimmy," says the keeper, "one drink at my
expense before you go."</p>

<p>"Not a taste," says Jimmy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?" the other says in an
aggrieved tone. "You're too damned proud to
drink with a poor cove like me. Here&mdash;give us
back that letter. I'm cursed if I'll accept a favour
from a man whose too almighty big to have a
drink with me."</p>

<p>"Well, well, mate, don't turn rusty," says Jim.
"Give us one drink an' I'm off."</p>

<p>The keeper pours out about half a pannikin of
raw rum and hands it to the bushman. The
moment he smells the old familiar smell his
longing for it returns, and he swigs it off at
a gulp. His eyes shine more brightly, and his
face becomes flushed. The keeper watches him
narrowly. "You can go now, Jim," he says.</p>

<p>"Steady, mate, steady," says the bushman. "I'm
as good a man as you. If you stand a drink, I
can stand one too, I suppose." So the pannikin is
replenished, and Jimmy's eyes shine brighter still.</p>

<p>"Now, Jimmy, one last drink for the good of
the house," says the keeper, "and then it's time
you were off." The stockman has a third gulp
from the pannikin, and with it all his scruples and
good resolutions vanish for ever.</p>

<p>"Look here," he says somewhat huskily, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
his cheque out of his pouch. "You take this,
mate. Whoever comes along this road, ask 'em
what they'll have, and tell them it's my shout.
Let me know when the money's done."</p>

<p>So Jimmy abandons the idea of ever getting to
town, and for three weeks or a month he lies
about the shanty in a state of extreme drunkenness,
and reduces every wayfarer upon the road
to the same condition. At last one fine morning
the keeper comes to him. "The coin's done,
Jimmy," he says; "it's about time you made some
more." So Jimmy has a good wash to sober him,
straps his blanket and his billy to his back, and
rides off through the bush to the sheep-run, where
he has another year of sobriety, terminating in
another month of intoxication.</p>

<p>All this, though typical of the happy-go-lucky
manners of the inhabitants, has no direct bearing
upon Jackman's Gulch, so we must return to that
Arcadian settlement. Additions to the population
there were not numerous, and such as came about
the time of which I speak were even rougher and
fiercer than the original inhabitants. In particular,
there came a brace of ruffians named Phillips and
Maule, who rode into camp one day and started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
a claim upon the other side of the stream. They
outgulched the Gulch in the virulence and fluency
of their blasphemy, in the truculence of their
speech and manner, and in their reckless disregard
of all social laws. They claimed to have
come from Bendigo, and there were some
amongst us who wished that the redoubted
Conky Jim was on the track once more, as long
as he would close it to such visitors as these.
After their arrival the nightly proceedings at the
"Britannia Bar" and at the gambling hell behind
became more riotous than ever. Violent quarrels,
frequently ending in bloodshed, were of constant
occurrence. The more peaceable frequenters of
the bar began to talk seriously of lynching the
two strangers who were the principal promoters of
disorder. Things were in this unsatisfactory condition
when our evangelist, Elias B. Hopkins,
came limping into the camp, travel-stained and
footsore, with his spade strapped across his back
and his Bible in the pocket of his moleskin jacket.</p>

<p>His presence was hardly noticed at first, so
insignificant was the man. His manner was quiet
and unobtrusive, his face pale, and his figure
fragile. On better acquaintance, however, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
was a squareness and firmness about his clean-shaven
lower jaw, and an intelligence in his
widely-opened blue eyes, which marked him as
a man of character. He erected a small hut for
himself, and started a claim close to that occupied
by the two strangers who had preceded him.
This claim was chosen with a ludicrous disregard
for all practical laws of mining, and at once
stamped the new-comer as being a green hand
at his work. It was piteous to observe him every
morning as we passed to our work, digging and
delving with the greatest industry, but, as we
knew well, without the smallest possibility of any
result. He would pause for a moment as we went
by, wipe his pale face with his bandanna handkerchief,
and shout out to us a cordial morning
greeting, and then fall to again with redoubled
energy. By degrees we got into the way of
making a half-pitying, half-contemptuous inquiry
as to how he got on. "I hain't struck it yet,
boys," he would answer cheerily, leaning on his
spade, "but the bed-rock lies deep just hereabouts,
and I reckon we'll get among the pay gravel
to-day." Day after day he returned the same
reply with unvarying confidence and cheerfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long before he began to show us
the stuff that was in him. One night the
proceedings were unusually violent at the drinking
saloon. A rich pocket had been struck
during the day, and the striker was standing
treat in a lavish and promiscuous fashion, which
had reduced three parts of the settlement to a
state of wild intoxication. A crowd of drunken
idlers stood or lay about the bar, cursing, swearing,
shouting, dancing, and here and there firing
their pistols into the air out of pure wantonness.
From the interior of the shanty behind there
came a similar chorus. Maule, Phillips, and the
roughs who followed them were in the ascendant,
and all order and decency was swept away.</p>

<p>Suddenly, amid this tumult of oaths and
drunken cries, men became conscious of a quiet
monotone which underlay all other sounds and
obtruded itself at every pause in the uproar.
Gradually first one man and then another paused
to listen, until there was a general cessation of
the hubbub, and every eye was turned in the
direction whence this quiet stream of words
flowed. There, mounted upon a barrel, was
Elias B. Hopkins, the newest of the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of Jackman's Gulch, with a good-humoured smile
upon his resolute face. He held an open Bible
in his hand, and was reading aloud a passage
taken at random&mdash;an extract from the Apocalypse,
if I remember right. The words were entirely
irrelevant, and without the smallest bearing upon
the scene before him; but he plodded on with
great unction, waving his left hand slowly to the
cadence of his words.</p>

<p>There was a general shout of laughter and
applause at this apparition, and Jackman's Gulch
gathered round the barrel approvingly, under the
impression that this was some ornate joke, and
that they were about to be treated to some mock
sermon or parody of the chapter read. When,
however, the reader, having finished the chapter,
placidly commenced another, and having finished
that rippled on into another one, the revellers
came to the conclusion that the joke was somewhat
too long-winded. The commencement of
yet another chapter confirmed this opinion, and an
angry chorus of shouts and cries, with suggestions
as to gagging the reader, or knocking him off the
barrel, rose from every side. In spite of roars and
hoots, however, Elias B. Hopkins plodded away at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the Apocalypse with the same serene countenance,
looking as ineffably contented as though the
babel around him were the most gratifying
applause. Before long an occasional boot pattered
against the barrel, or whistled past our parson's
head; but here some of the more orderly of the
inhabitants interfered in favour of peace and
order, aided curiously enough by the afore-mentioned
Maule and Phillips, who warmly espoused
the cause of the little Scripture-reader. "The
little cuss has got grit in him," the latter explained,
rearing his bulky red-shirted form between the
crowd and the object of its anger. "His ways
ain't our ways, and we're all welcome to our
opinions, and to sling them round from barrels
or otherwise, if so minded. What I says, and
Bill says, is, that when it comes to slingin' boots
instead o' words it's too steep by half; an' if
this man's wronged we'll chip in an' see him
righted." This oratorical effort had the effect of
checking the more active signs of disapproval,
and the party of disorder attempted to settle
down once more to their carouse, and to ignore
the shower of Scripture which was poured upon
them. The attempt was hopeless. The drunken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
portion fell asleep under the drowsy refrain, and
the others, with many a sullen glance at the
imperturbable reader, slouched off to their huts,
leaving him still perched upon the barrel. Finding
himself alone with the more orderly of the
spectators, the little man rose, closed his book,
after methodically marking with a lead pencil the
exact spot at which he stopped, and descended
from his perch. "To-morrow night, boys," he
remarked in his quiet voice, "the reading will
commence at the 9th verse of the 15th chapter
of the Apocalypse," with which piece of information,
disregarding our congratulations, he walked
away with the air of a man who has performed
an obvious duty.</p>

<p>We found that his parting words were no empty
threat. Hardly had the crowd begun to assemble
next night before he appeared once more upon
the barrel and began to read with the same
monotonous vigour, tripping over words, muddling
up sentences, but still boring along through chapter
after chapter. Laughter, threats, chaff&mdash;every
weapon short of actual violence&mdash;was used to deter
him, but all with the same want of success. Soon
it was found that there was a method in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
proceedings. When silence reigned, or when the
conversation was of an innocent nature, the reading
ceased. A single word of blasphemy, however,
set it going again, and it would ramble on for a
quarter of an hour or so, when it stopped, only to
be renewed upon similar provocation. The reading
was pretty continuous during that second night, for
the language of the opposition was still considerably
free. At least it was an improvement upon
the night before.</p>

<p>For more than a month Elias B. Hopkins
carried on this campaign. There he would sit,
night after night, with the open book upon his
knee, and at the slightest provocation off he would
go, like a musical box when the spring is touched.
The monotonous drawl became unendurable, but
it could only be avoided by conforming to the
parson's code. A chronic swearer came to be
looked upon with disfavour by the community,
since the punishment of his transgression fell upon
all. At the end of a fortnight the reader was
silent more than half the time, and at the end of
the month his position was a sinecure.</p>

<p>Never was a moral revolution brought about
more rapidly and more completely. Our parson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
carried his principle into private life. I have seen
him, on hearing an unguarded word from some
worker in the gulches, rush across, Bible in hand,
and perching himself upon the heap of red clay
which surmounted the offender's claim, drawl
through the genealogical tree at the commencement
of the New Testament in a most earnest and
impressive manner, as though it were especially
appropriate to the occasion. In time an oath
became a rare thing amongst us. Drunkenness
was on the wane too. Casual travellers passing
through the Gulch used to marvel at our state of
grace, and rumours of it went as far as Ballarat,
and excited much comment therein.</p>

<p>There were points about our evangelist which
made him especially fitted for the work which he
had undertaken. A man entirely without redeeming
vices would have had no common basis on
which to work, and no means of gaining the
sympathy of his flock. As we came to know Elias
B. Hopkins better, we discovered that in spite of
his piety there was a leaven of old Adam in him,
and that he had certainly known unregenerate
days. He was no teetotaler. On the contrary, he
could choose his liquor with discrimination, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
lower it in an able manner. He played a masterly
hand at poker, and there were few who could touch
him at "cut-throat euchre." He and the two ex-ruffians,
Phillips and Maule, used to play for hours
in perfect harmony, except when the fall of the
cards elicited an oath from one of his companions.
At the first of these offences the parson would put
on a pained smile and gaze reproachfully at the
culprit. At the second he would reach for his
Bible, and the game was over for the evening. He
showed us he was a good revolver shot too, for
when we were practising at an empty brandy
bottle outside Adams' bar, he took up a friend's
pistol and hit it plumb in the centre at twenty-four
paces. There were few things he took up that he
could not make a show at apparently, except gold-digging,
and at that he was the veriest duffer alive.
It was pitiful to see the little canvas bag, with his
name printed across it, lying placid and empty
upon the shelf at Woburn's store, while all the
other bags were increasing daily, and some had
assumed quite a portly rotundity of form, for the
weeks were slipping by, and it was almost time
for the gold-train to start off for Ballarat. We
reckoned that the amount which we had stored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
at the time represented the greatest sum which
had ever been taken by a single convoy out of
Jackman's Gulch.</p>

<p>Although Elias B. Hopkins appeared to derive
a certain quiet satisfaction from the wonderful
change which he had effected in the camp, his joy
was not yet rounded and complete. There was
one thing for which he still yearned. He opened
his heart to us about it one evening.</p>

<p>"We'd have a blessing on the camp, boys," he
said, "if we only had a service o' some sort on the
Lord's day. It's a temptin' o' Providence to go
on in this way without takin' any notice of it,
except that maybe there's more whisky drunk and
more card-playin' than on any other day."</p>

<p>"We hain't got no parson," objected one of the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Ye fool!" growled another, "hain't we got a
man as is worth any three parsons, and can splash
texts around like clay out o' a cradle? What more
d'ye want?"</p>

<p>"We hain't got no church!" urged the same
dissentient.</p>

<p>"Have it in the open air," one suggested.</p>

<p>"Or in Woburn's store," said another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or in Adams' saloon."</p>

<p>The last proposal was received with a buzz of
approval, which showed that it was considered the
most appropriate locality.</p>

<p>Adams' saloon was a substantial wooden building
in the rear of the bar, which was used partly
for storing liquor and partly for a gambling saloon.
It was strongly built of rough-hewn logs, the
proprietor rightly judging, in the unregenerate
days of Jackman's Gulch, that hogsheads of brandy
and rum were commodities which had best be
secured under lock and key. A strong door
opened into each end of the saloon, and the
interior was spacious enough, when the table and
lumber were cleared away, to accommodate the
whole population. The spirit barrels were heaped
together at one end by their owner, so as to make
a very fair imitation of a pulpit.</p>

<p>At first the Gulch took but a mild interest in
the proceedings, but when it became known that
Elias B. Hopkins intended, after reading the
service, to address the audience, the settlement
began to warm up to the occasion. A real sermon
was a novelty to all of them, and one coming from
their own parson was additionally so. Rumour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
announced that it would be interspersed with local
hits, and that the moral would be pointed by
pungent personalities. Men began to fear that
they would be unable to gain seats, and many
applications were made to the brothers Adams.
It was only when conclusively shown that the
saloon could contain them all with a margin that
the camp settled down into calm expectancy.</p>

<p>It was as well that the building was of such a
size, for the assembly upon the Sunday morning
was the largest which had ever occurred in the
annals of Jackman's Gulch. At first it was thought
that the whole population was present, but a little
reflection showed that this was not so. Maule
and Phillips had gone on a prospecting journey
among the hills, and had not returned as yet; and
Woburn, the gold-keeper, was unable to leave his
store. Having a very large quantity of the
precious metal under his charge, he stuck to his
post, feeling that the responsibility was too great
to trifle with. With these three exceptions the
whole of the Gulch, with clean red shirts, and such
other additions to their toilet as the occasion
demanded, sauntered in a straggling line along the
clayey pathway which led up to the saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>The interior of the building had been provided
with rough benches; and the parson, with his quiet,
good-humoured smile, was standing at the door to
welcome them. "Good morning, boys," he cried
cheerily, as each group came lounging up. "Pass
in! pass in. You'll find this is as good a morning's
work as any you've done. Leave your pistols in
this barrel outside the door as you pass; you can
pick them out as you come out again; but it isn't
the thing to carry weapons into the house of peace."
His request was good-humouredly complied with,
and before the last of the congregation filed in
there was a strange assortment of knives and firearms
in this depository. When all had assembled
the doors were shut and the service began&mdash;the
first and the last which was ever performed at
Jackman's Gulch.</p>

<p>The weather was sultry and the room close, yet
the miners listened with exemplary patience.
There was a sense of novelty in the situation
which had its attractions. To some it was entirely
new, others were wafted back by it to another land
and other days. Beyond a disposition which was
exhibited by the uninitiated to applaud at the end
of certain prayers, by way of showing that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
sympathised with the sentiments expressed, no
audience could have behaved better. There was
a murmur of interest, however, when Elias B.
Hopkins, looking down on the congregation from
his rostrum of casks, began his address.</p>

<p>He had attired himself with care in honour of
the occasion. He wore a velveteen tunic, girt
round the waist with a sash of china silk, a pair of
moleskin trousers, and held his cabbage-tree hat in
his left hand. He began speaking in a low tone,
and it was noticed at the time that he frequently
glanced through the small aperture which served
for a window, which was placed above the heads of
those who sat beneath him.</p>

<p>"I've put you straight now," he said, in the
course of his address; "I've got you in the right
rut, if you will but stick in it." Here he looked
very hard out of the window for some seconds.
"You've learned soberness and industry, and with
those things you can always make up any loss you
may sustain. I guess there isn't one of ye that
won't remember my visit to this camp." He
paused for a moment, and three revolver shots rang
out upon the quiet summer air. "Keep your seats,
damn ye!" roared our preacher, as his audience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
rose in excitement. "If a man of ye moves, down
he goes! The door's locked on the outside, so ye
can't get out anyhow. Your seats, ye canting,
chuckle-headed fools! Down with ye, ye dogs, or
I'll fire among ye!"</p>

<p>Astonishment and fear brought us back into
our seats, and we sat staring blankly at our pastor
and each other. Elias B. Hopkins, whose whole
face and even figure appeared to have undergone
an extraordinary alteration, looked fiercely down
on us from his commanding position with a contemptuous
smile on his stern face.</p>

<p>"I have your lives in my hands," he remarked;
and we noticed as he spoke that he held a heavy
revolver in his hand, and that the butt of another
one protruded from his sash. "I am armed and
you are not. If one of you moves or speaks, he is
a dead man. If not, I shall not harm you. You
must wait here for an hour. Why, you <i>fools</i>"
(this with a hiss of contempt which rang in our
ears for many a long day), "do you know who
it is that has stuck you up? Do you know who
it is that has been playing it upon you for months
as a parson and a saint? Conky Jim, the bushranger,
ye apes! And Phillips and Maule were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
my two right-hand men. They're off into the
hills with your gold&mdash;&mdash; Ha! would ye?" This
to some restive member of the audience, who
quieted down instantly before the fierce eye and
the ready weapon of the bushranger. "In an
hour they will be clear of any pursuit, and I advise
you to make the best of it and not to follow, or
you may lose more than your money. My horse
is tethered outside this door behind me. When
the time is up I shall pass through it, lock it on
the outside, and be off. Then you may break
your way out as best you can. I have no more
to say to you, except that ye are the most cursed
set of asses that ever trod in boot-leather."</p>

<p>We had time to endorse mentally this outspoken
opinion during the long sixty minutes which
followed; we were powerless before the resolute
desperado. It is true that if we made a simultaneous
rush we might bear him down at the cost
of eight or ten of our number. But how could
such a rush be organised without speaking, and
who would attempt it without a previous agreement
that he would be supported? There was
nothing for it but submission. It seemed three
hours at the least before the ranger snapped up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
his watch, stepped down from the barrel, walked
backwards, still covering us with his weapon, to
the door behind him, and then passed rapidly
through it. We heard the creaking of the rusty
lock, and the clatter of his horse's hoofs as he
galloped away.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that an oath had for the
last few weeks been a rare thing in the camp. We
made up for our temporary abstention during the
next half-hour. Never was heard such symmetrical
and heartfelt blasphemy. When at last we
succeeded in getting the door off its hinges all
sight of both rangers and treasure had disappeared,
nor have we ever caught sight of either the one or
the other since. Poor Woburn, true to his trust,
lay shot through the head across the threshold of
his empty store. The villains, Maule and Phillips,
had descended upon the camp the instant that
we had been enticed into the trap, murdered the
keeper, loaded up a small cart with the booty, and
got safe away to some wild fastness among the
mountains, where they were joined by their wily
leader.</p>

<p>Jackman's Gulch recovered from this blow, and
is now a flourishing township. Social reformers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
are not in request there, however, and morality is
at a discount. It is said that an inquest has been
held lately upon an unoffending stranger who
chanced to remark that in so large a place it
would be advisable to have some form of Sunday
service. The memory of their one and only pastor
is still green among the inhabitants, and will be for
many a long year to come.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class ="smcap">"Number 43</span> is no better, Doctor," said the head-warder
in a slightly reproachful accent, looking in
round the corner of my door.</p>

<p>"Confound 43!" I responded from behind the
pages of the <i>Australian Sketcher</i>.</p>

<p>"And 61 says his tubes are paining him. Couldn't
you do anything for him?"</p>

<p>"He's a walking drug shop," said I. "He has
the whole British pharmacop&oelig;ia inside him. I
believe his tubes are as sound as yours are."</p>

<p>"Then there's 7 and 108, they are chronic,"
continued the warder, glancing down a blue slip of
paper. "And 28 knocked off work yesterday&mdash;said
lifting things gave him a stitch in the side. I
want you to have a look at him, if you don't mind,
Doctor. There's 31, too&mdash;him that killed John
Adamson in the <i>Corinthian</i> brig&mdash;he's been carrying
on awful in the night, shrieking and yelling,
he has, and no stopping him neither."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, I'll have a look at him afterwards,"
I said, tossing my paper carelessly aside, and pouring
myself out a cup of coffee. "Nothing else to
report, I suppose, warder?"</p>

<p>The official protruded his head a little further
into the room. "Beg pardon, Doctor," he said,
in a confidential tone, "but I notice as 82 has a
bit of a cold, and it would be a good excuse for
you to visit him and have a chat, maybe."</p>

<p>The cup of coffee was arrested half-way to my
lips as I stared in amazement at the man's serious
face.</p>

<p>"An excuse?" I said. "An excuse? What
the deuce are you talking about, McPherson?
You see me trudging about all day at my practice,
when I'm not looking after the prisoners, and
coming back every night as tired as a dog, and
you talk about finding an excuse for doing more
work."</p>

<p>"You'd like it, Doctor," said Warder McPherson,
insinuating one of his shoulders into the room.
"That man's story's worth listening to if you could
get him to tell it, though he's not what you'd call
free in his speech. Maybe you don't know who
82 is?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I don't, and I don't care either," I answered,
in the conviction that some local ruffian was about
to be foisted upon me as a celebrity.</p>

<p>"He's Maloney," said the warder, "him that
turned Queen's evidence after the murders at
Bluemansdyke."</p>

<p>"You don't say so?" I ejaculated, laying down
my cup in astonishment. I had heard of this
ghastly series of murders, and read an account
of them in a London magazine long before setting
foot in the colony. I remembered that the
atrocities committed had thrown the Burke and
Hare crimes completely into the shade, and that
one of the most villainous of the gang had saved
his own skin by betraying his companions. "Are
you sure?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it's him right enough. Just you draw
him out a bit, and he'll astonish you. He's a man
to know, is Maloney; that's to say, in moderation;"
and the head grinned, bobbed, and disappeared,
leaving me to finish my breakfast and ruminate
over what I had heard.</p>

<p>The surgeonship of an Australian prison is not
an enviable position. It may be endurable in Melbourne
or Sydney, but the little town of Perth has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
few attractions to recommend it, and those few
had been long exhausted. The climate was detestable,
and the society far from congenial.
Sheep and cattle were the staple support of
the community; and their prices, breeding, and
diseases the principal topic of conversation. Now
as I, being an outsider, possessed neither the one
nor the other, and was utterly callous to the new
"dip" and the "rot" and other kindred topics, I
found myself in a state of mental isolation, and
was ready to hail anything which might relieve
the monotony of my existence. Maloney, the
murderer, had at least some distinctiveness and
individuality in his character, and might act as a
tonic to a mind sick of the commonplaces of
existence. I determined that I should follow the
warder's advice, and take the excuse for making
his acquaintance. When, therefore, I went upon
my usual matutinal round, I turned the lock of
the door which bore the convict's number upon
it, and walked into the cell.</p>

<p>The man was lying in a heap upon his rough
bed as I entered, but, uncoiling his long limbs, he
started up and stared at me with an insolent look
of defiance on his face which augured badly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
our interview. He had a pale set face, with sandy
hair and a steelly-blue eye, with something feline
in its expression. His frame was tall and muscular,
though there was a curious bend in his
shoulders, which almost amounted to a deformity.
An ordinary observer meeting him in the street
might have put him down as a well-developed
man, fairly handsome, and of studious habits&mdash;even
in the hideous uniform of the rottenest convict
establishment he imparted a certain refinement
to his carriage which marked him out among
the inferior ruffians around him.</p>

<p>"I'm not on the sick-list," he said gruffly.
There was something in the hard, rasping voice
which dispelled all softer allusions, and made me
realise that I was face to face with the man of
the Lena Valley and Bluemansdyke, the bloodiest
bushranger that ever stuck up a farm or cut the
throats of its occupants.</p>

<p>"I know you're not," I answered. "Warder
McPherson told me you had a cold, though, and I
thought I'd look in and see you."</p>

<p>"Blast Warder McPherson, and blast you, too!"
yelled the convict, in a paroxysm of rage. "Oh,
that's right," he added, in a quieter voice; "hurry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
away; report me to the governor, do! Get me
another six months or so&mdash;that's your game."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to report you," I said.</p>

<p>"Eight square feet of ground," he went on,
disregarding my protest, and evidently working
himself into a fury again. "Eight square feet,
and I can't have that without being talked to and
stared at, and&mdash;oh, blast the whole crew of you!"
and he raised his two clenched hands above his
head and shook them in passionate invective.</p>

<p>"You've got a curious idea of hospitality," I
remarked, determined not to lose my temper, and
saying almost the first thing that came to my
tongue.</p>

<p>To my surprise the words had an extraordinary
effect upon him. He seemed completely staggered
at my assuming the proposition for which he had
been so fiercely contending&mdash;namely, that the room
in which we stood was his own.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said; "I didn't mean
to be rude. Won't you take a seat?" and he motioned
towards a rough trestle, which formed the
headpiece of his couch.</p>

<p>I sat down rather astonished at the sudden
change. I don't know that I liked Maloney better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
under his new aspect. The murderer had, it is true,
disappeared for the nonce, but there was something
in the smooth tones and obsequious manner
which powerfully suggested the witness of the
Queen, who had stood up and sworn away the
lives of his companions in crime.</p>

<p>"How's your chest?" I asked, putting on my
professional air.</p>

<p>"Come, drop it, Doctor, drop it!" he answered,
showing a row of white teeth as he resumed his
seat upon the side of the bed. "It wasn't anxiety
after my precious health that brought you along
here; that story won't wash at all. You came to
have a look at Wolf Tone Maloney, forger, murderer,
Sydney-slider, ranger, and Government
peach. That's about my figure, ain't it? There
it is, plain and straight; there's nothing mean
about me."</p>

<p>He paused as if he expected me to say something;
but as I remained silent, he repeated once
or twice, "There's nothing mean about me."</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't I?" he suddenly yelled,
his eyes gleaming and his whole satanic nature
reasserting itself. "We were bound to swing, one
and all, and they were none the worse if I saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
myself by turning against them. Every man for
himself, say I, and the devil take the luckiest.
You haven't a plug of tobacco, Doctor, have you?"</p>

<p>He tore at the piece of "Barrett's" which I
handed him as ravenously as a wild beast. It
seemed to have the effect of soothing his nerves,
for he settled himself down in the bed, and
reassumed his former deprecating manner.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like it yourself, you know, Doctor,"
he said; "it's enough to make any man a little
queer in his temper. I'm in for six months this
time for assault, and very sorry I shall be to go
out again, I can tell you. My mind's at ease in
here; but when I'm outside, what with the Government,
and what with Tattooed Tom of Hawkesbury,
there's no chance of a quiet life."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He's the brother of John Grimthorpe; the
same that was condemned on my evidence, and an
infernal scamp he was too! Spawn of the devil,
both of them! This tattooed one is a murderous
ruffian, and he swore to have my blood after that
trial. It's seven year ago, and he's following me
yet; I know he is, though he lies low and keeps
dark. He came up to me in Ballarat in '75; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
can see on the back of my hand here where the
bullet clipped me. He tried again in '76, at Port
Philip, but I got the drop on him and wounded
him badly. He knifed me in '79 though, in a bar
at Adelaide, and that made our account about level.
He's loafing round again now, and he'll let daylight
into me&mdash;unless&mdash;unless by some extraordinary
chance some one does as much for him." And
Maloney gave a very ugly smile.</p>

<p>"I don't complain of <i>him</i> so much," he continued.
"Looking at it in his way, no doubt it
is a sort of family matter that can hardly be
neglected. It's the Government that fetches me.
When I think of what I've done for this country,
and then of what this country has done for me,
it makes me fairly wild&mdash;clean drives me off my
head. There's no gratitude nor common decency
left, Doctor!"</p>

<p>He brooded over his wrongs for a few minutes,
and then proceeded to lay them before me in
detail.</p>

<p>"Here's nine men," he said, "they've been
murdering and killing for a matter of three years,
and maybe a life a week wouldn't more than average
the work that they've done. The Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
catches them and the Government tries them,
but they can't convict; and why?&mdash;because
the witnesses have all had their throats cut, and
the whole job's been very neatly done. What
happens then? Up comes a citizen called Wolf
Tone Maloney; he says, 'The country needs me,
and here I am.' And with that he gives his
evidence, convicts the lot, and enables the beaks to
hang them. That's what I did. There's nothing
mean about me! And now what does the country
do in return? Dogs me, sir, spies on me, watches
me night and day, turns against the very man that
worked so hard for it. There's something mean
about that, anyway. I didn't expect them to
knight me, nor to make me Colonial Secretary;
but, damn it, I did expect that they would let me
alone!"</p>

<p>"Well," I remonstrated, "if you choose to break
laws and assault people, you can't expect it to be
looked over on account of former services."</p>

<p>"I don't refer to my present imprisonment, sir,"
said Maloney, with dignity. "It's the life I've
been leading since that cursed trial that takes the
soul out of me. Just you sit there on that trestle,
and I'll tell you all about it; and then look me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the face and tell me that I've been treated fair by
the police."</p>

<p>I shall endeavour to transcribe the experiences
of the convict in his own words, as far as I can
remember them, preserving his curious perversions
of right and wrong. I can answer for the truth of
his facts, whatever may be said for his deductions
from them. Months afterwards, Inspector H. W.
Hann, formerly governor of the gaol at Dunedin,
showed me entries in his ledger which corroborated
every statement. Maloney reeled the story off in
a dull, monotonous voice, with his head sunk upon
his breast and his hands between his knees. The
glitter of his serpent-like eyes was the only sign of
the emotions which were stirred up by the recollection
of the events which he narrated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You've read of Bluemansdyke (he began, with
some pride in his tone). We made it hot while it
lasted; but they ran us to earth at last, and a trap
called Braxton, with a damned Yankee, took the
lot of us. That was in New Zealand, of course,
and they took us down to Dunedin, and there they
were convicted and hanged. One and all they put
up their hands in the dock, and cursed me till your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
blood would have run cold to hear them, which
was scurvy treatment, seeing that we had all been
pals together; but they were a blackguard lot, and
thought only of themselves. I think it is as well
that they were hung.</p>

<p>They took me back to Dunedin gaol, and
clapped me into the old cell. The only difference
they made was, that I had no work to do, and was
well fed. I stood this for a week or two, until one
day the governor was making his round, and I put
the matter to him.</p>

<p>"How's this?" I said. "My conditions were a free
pardon, and you're keeping me here against the law."</p>

<p>He gave a sort of a smile. "Should you like
very much to go out?" he asked.</p>

<p>"So much," said I, "that, unless you open that
door, I'll have an action against you for illegal
detention."</p>

<p>He seemed a bit astonished by my resolution.
"You're very anxious to meet your death," he said.</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Come here, and you'll know what I mean," he
answered. And he led me down the passage to a
window that overlooked the door of the prison.
"Look at that!" said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked out, and there were a dozen or so
rough-looking fellows standing outside in the
street, some of them smoking, some playing cards
on the pavement. When they saw me they gave
a yell, and crowded round the door, shaking their
fists and hooting.</p>

<p>"They wait for you, watch and watch about,"
said the governor. "They're the executive of the
vigilance committee. However, since you are
determined to go, I can't stop you."</p>

<p>"D'ye call this a civilised land," I cried, "and
let a man be murdered in cold blood in open daylight?"</p>

<p>When I said this the governor and the warder
and every fool in the place grinned, as if a man's
life was a rare good joke.</p>

<p>"You've got the law on your side," says the
governor; "so we won't detain you any longer.
Show him out, warder."</p>

<p>He'd have done it too, the black-hearted villain,
if I hadn't begged and prayed and offered to pay
for my board and lodging, which is more than any
prisoner ever did before me. He let me stay on
those conditions; and for three months I was
caged up there with every larrikin in the township<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
clamouring at the other side of the wall. That
was pretty treatment for a man that had served his
country!</p>

<p>At last, one morning, up came the governor
again.</p>

<p>"Well, Maloney," he said, "how long are you
going to honour us with your society?"</p>

<p>I could have put a knife into his cursed body,
and would, too, if we had been alone in the bush;
but I had to smile, and smooth him and flatter, for
I feared that he might have me sent out.</p>

<p>"You're an infernal rascal," he said; those were
his very words to a man that had helped him all
he knew how. "I don't want any rough justice
here, though; and I think I see my way to getting
you out of Dunedin."</p>

<p>"I'll never forget you, governor," said I; and, by
God, I never will.</p>

<p>"I don't want your thanks nor your gratitude,"
he answered; "it's not for your sake that I do it,
but simply to keep order in the town. There's a
steamer starts from the West Quay to Melbourne
to-morrow, and we'll get you aboard it. She is
advertised at five in the morning, so have yourself
in readiness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>I packed up the few things I had, and was
smuggled out by a back door just before daybreak.
I hurried down, took my ticket, under the name of
Isaac Smith, and got safely aboard the Melbourne
boat. I remember hearing her screw grinding into
the water as the warps were cast loose, and looking
back at the lights of Dunedin, as I leaned upon
the bulwarks, with the pleasant thought that I was
leaving them behind me for ever. It seemed to
me that a new world was before me, and that all
my troubles had been cast off. I went down
below and had some coffee, and came up again
feeling better than I had done since the morning
that I woke to find that cursed Irishman that took
me standing over me with a six-shooter.</p>

<p>Day had dawned by that time, and we were
steaming along by the coast, well out of sight
of Dunedin. I loafed about for a couple of hours,
and when the sun got well up some of the other
passengers came on deck and joined me. One
of them, a little perky sort of fellow, took a good
long look at me, and then came over and began
talking.</p>

<p>"Mining, I suppose?" says he.</p>

<p>"Yes," I says.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Made your pile?" he asks.</p>

<p>"Pretty fair," says I.</p>

<p>"I was at it myself," he says; "I worked at
the Nelson fields for three months, and spent all
I made in buying a salted claim which busted
up the second day. I went at it again, though,
and struck it rich; but when the gold waggon
was going down to the settlements, it was stuck
up by those cursed rangers, and not a red cent
left."</p>

<p>"That was a bad job," I says.</p>

<p>"Broke me&mdash;ruined me clean. Never mind,
I've seen them all hanged for it; that makes it
easier to bear. There's only one left&mdash;the villain
that gave the evidence. I'd die happy if I could
come across him. There are two things I have
to do if I meet him."</p>

<p>"What's that?" says I carelessly.</p>

<p>"I've got to ask him where the money lies&mdash;they
never had time to make away with it, and it's <i>cachéd</i>
somewhere in the mountains&mdash;and then I've got
to stretch his neck for him, and send his soul down
to join the men that he betrayed."</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I knew something about
that <i>caché</i>, and I felt like laughing; but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
watching me, and it struck me that he had a nasty,
vindictive kind of mind.</p>

<p>"I'm going up on the bridge," I said, for he
was not a man whose acquaintance I cared much
about making.</p>

<p>He wouldn't hear of my leaving him, though.
"We're both miners," he says, "and we're pals
for the voyage. Come down to the bar. I'm not
too poor to shout."</p>

<p>I couldn't refuse him well, and we went down
together; and that was the beginning of the
trouble. What harm was I doing any one on the
ship? All I asked for was a quiet life, leaving
others alone, and getting left alone myself. No
man could ask fairer than that. And now just
you listen to what came of it.</p>

<p>We were passing the front of the ladies' cabins,
on our way to the saloon, when out comes a servant
lass&mdash;a freckled currency she-devil&mdash;with a baby
in her arms. We were brushing past her, when
she gave a scream like a railway whistle, and
nearly dropped the kid. My nerves gave a sort
of a jump when I heard that scream, but I turned
and begged her pardon, letting on that I thought
I might have trod on her foot. I knew the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
was up though, when I saw her white face, and
her leaning against the door and pointing.</p>

<p>"It's him!" she cried; "it's him! I saw him
in the court-house. Oh, don't let him hurt the
baby!"</p>

<p>"Who is it?" asks the steward and half-a-dozen
others in a breath.</p>

<p>"It's him&mdash;Maloney&mdash;Maloney, the murderer&mdash;oh,
take him away&mdash;take him away!"</p>

<p>I don't rightly remember what happened just
at that moment. The furniture and me seemed
to get kind of mixed, and there was cursing, and
smashing, and some one shouting for his gold,
and a general stamp round. When I got steadied
a bit, I found somebody's hand in my mouth.
From what I gathered afterwards, I conclude that
it belonged to that same little man with the vicious
way of talking. He got some of it out again,
but that was because the others were choking
me. A poor chap can get no fair-play in this
world when once he is down&mdash;still I think he will
remember me till the day of his death&mdash;longer,
I hope.</p>

<p>They dragged me out into the poop and held
a damned court-martial&mdash;on <i>me</i>, mind you; <i>me</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
that had thrown over my pals in order to serve
them. What were they to do with me? Some
said this, some said that; but it ended by the
captain deciding to send me ashore. The ship
stopped, they lowered a boat, and I was hoisted
in, the whole gang of them hooting at me from
over the bulwarks. I saw the man I spoke of
tying up his hand though, and I felt that things
might be worse.</p>

<p>I changed my opinion before we got to the
land. I had reckoned on the shore being deserted,
and that I might make my way inland; but the
ship had stopped too near the Heads, and a dozen
beach-combers and such like had come down to
the water's edge, and were staring at us, wondering
what the boat was after. When we got to the edge
of the surf the coxswain hailed them, and after
singing out who I was, he and his men threw
me into the water. You may well look surprised&mdash;neck
and crop into ten feet of water, with shark
as thick as green parrots in the bush, and I heard
them laughing as I floundered to the shore.</p>

<p>I soon saw it was a worse job than ever. As
I came scrambling out through the weeds, I was
collared by a big chap with a velveteen coat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
half-a-dozen others got round me and held me
fast. Most of them looked simple fellows enough,
and I was not afraid of them; but there was one
in a cabbage-tree hat that had a very nasty
expression on his face, and the big man seemed
to be chummy with him.</p>

<p>They dragged me up the beach, and then they let
go their hold of me and stood round in a circle.</p>

<p>"Well, mate," says the man with the hat, "we've
been looking out for you some time in these
parts."</p>

<p>"And very good of you too," I answers.</p>

<p>"None of your jaw," says he. "Come, boys,
what shall it be&mdash;hanging, drowning, or shooting?
Look sharp!"</p>

<p>This looked a bit too like business. "No you
don't!" I said. "I've got Government protection,
and it'll be murder."</p>

<p>"That's what they call it," answered the one
in the velveteen coat as cheery as a piping crow.</p>

<p>"And you're going to murder me for being
a ranger?"</p>

<p>"Ranger be damned!" said the man. "We're
going to hang you for peaching against your
pals; and that's an end of the palaver."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>They slung a rope round my neck and dragged
me up to the edge of the bush. There were some
big she-oaks and blue-gums, and they pitched on
one of these for the wicked deed. They ran the
rope over a branch, tied my hands, and told me to
say my prayers. It seemed as if it was all up; but
Providence interfered to save me. It sounds nice
enough sitting here and telling about it, sir; but it
was sick work to stand with nothing but the
beach in front of you, and the long white line of
surf, with the steamer in the distance, and a set of
bloody-minded villains round you thirsting for
your life.</p>

<p>I never thought I'd owe anything good to the
police; but they saved me that time. A troop of
them were riding from Hawkes Point Station to
Dunedin, and hearing that something was up, they
came down through the bush, and interrupted the
proceedings. I've heard some bands in my time,
Doctor, but I never heard music like the jingle of
those traps' spurs and harness as they galloped out
on to the open. They tried to hang me even then,
but the police were too quick for them; and the
man with the hat got one over the head with the
flat of a sword. I was clapped on to a horse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
before evening I found myself in my old quarters
in the city gaol.</p>

<p>The governor wasn't to be done, though. He
was determined to get rid of me, and I was equally
anxious to see the last of him. He waited a week
or so until the excitement had begun to die away,
and then he smuggled me aboard a three-masted
schooner bound to Sydney with tallow and hides.</p>

<p>We got fair away to sea without a hitch, and
things began to look a bit more rosy. I made
sure that I had seen the last of the prison, anyway.
The crew had a sort of an idea who I was, and if
there'd been any rough weather, they'd have hove
me overboard like enough; for they were a rough,
ignorant lot, and had a notion that I brought bad
luck to the ship. We had a good passage, however,
and I was landed safe and sound upon
Sydney Quay.</p>

<p>Now just you listen to what happened next.
You'd have thought they would have been sick of
ill-using me and following me by this time&mdash;wouldn't
you, now? Well, just you listen. It
seems that a cursed steamer started from Dunedin
to Sydney on the very day we left, and got in
before us, bringing news that I was coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Blessed if they hadn't called a meeting&mdash;a regular
mass meeting&mdash;at the docks to discuss about it,
and I marched right into it when I landed. They
didn't take long about arresting me, and I listened
to all the speeches and resolutions. If I'd been a
prince there couldn't have been more excitement.
The end of it all was that they agreed that it
wasn't right that New Zealand should be allowed
to foist her criminals upon her neighbours, and
that I was to be sent back again by the next boat.
So they posted me off again as if I was a damned
parcel; and after another eight hundred mile
journey I found myself back for the third time
moving in the place that I started from.</p>

<p>By this time I had begun to think that I was
going to spend the rest of my existence travelling
about from one port to another. Every man's
hand seemed turned against me, and there was no
peace or quiet in any direction. I was about sick
of it by the time I had come back; and if I could
have taken to the bush I'd have done it, and
chanced it with my old pals. They were too
quick for me, though, and kept me under lock and
key; but I managed, in spite of them, to negotiate
that <i>caché</i> I told you of, and sewed the gold up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
my belt. I spent another month in gaol, and then
they slipped me aboard a barque that was bound
for England.</p>

<p>This time the crew never knew who I was, but
the captain had a pretty good idea, though he
didn't let on to me that he had any suspicions. I
guessed from the first that the man was a villain.
We had a fair passage, except a gale or two off
the Cape; and I began to feel like a free man when
I saw the blue loom of the old country, and the
saucy little pilot-boat from Falmouth dancing
towards us over the waves. We ran down the
Channel, and before we reached Gravesend I had
agreed with the pilot that he should take me
ashore with him when he left. It was at this time
that the captain showed me that I was right in
thinking him a meddling, disagreeable man. I
got my things packed, such as they were, and left
him talking earnestly to the pilot, while I went
below for my breakfast. When I came up again
we were fairly into the mouth of the river, and the
boat in which I was to have gone ashore had left
us. The skipper said the pilot had forgotten me; but
that was too thin, and I began to fear that all my
old troubles were going to commence once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long before my suspicions were confirmed.
A boat darted out from the side of the
river, and a tall cove with a long black beard came
aboard. I heard him ask the mate whether they
didn't need a mud-pilot to take them up the
reaches, but it seemed to me that he was a man
who would know a deal more about handcuffs than
he did about steering, so I kept away from him.
He came across the deck, however, and made
some remark to me, taking a good look at me the
while. I don't like inquisitive people at any time,
but an inquisitive stranger with glue about the
roots of his beard is the worst of all to stand,
especially under the circumstances. I began to
feel that it was time for me to go.</p>

<p>I soon got a chance, and made good use of it.
A big collier came athwart the bows of our
steamer, and we had to slacken down to dead
slow. There was a barge astern, and I slipped
down by a rope and was into the barge before
any one had missed me. Of course I had to leave
my luggage behind me, but I had the belt with
the nuggets round my waist, and the chance of
shaking the police off my track was worth more
than a couple of boxes. It was clear to me now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
that the pilot had been a traitor, as well as the
captain, and had set the detectives after me. I
often wish I could drop across those two men
again.</p>

<p>I hung about the barge all day as she drifted
down the stream. There was one man in her, but
she was a big, ugly craft, and his hands were too
full for much looking about. Towards evening,
when it got a bit dusky, I struck out for the shore,
and found myself in a sort of marsh place, a good
many miles to the east of London. I was soaking
wet and half dead with hunger, but I trudged into
the town, got a new rig-out at a slop-shop, and
after having some supper, engaged a bed at the
quietest lodgings I could find.</p>

<p>I woke pretty early&mdash;a habit you pick up in the
bush&mdash;and lucky for me that I did so. The very
first thing I saw when I took a look through a
chink in the shutter was one of these infernal policemen
standing right opposite, and staring up at the
windows. He hadn't epaulettes nor a sword, like
our traps, but for all that there was a sort of
family likeness, and the same busybody expression.
Whether they'd followed me all the time, or
whether the woman that let me the bed didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
like the looks of me, is more than I have ever been
able to find out. He came across as I was watching
him, and noted down the address of the house
in a book. I was afraid that he was going to ring
at the bell, but I suppose his orders were simply
to keep an eye on me, for after another good look
at the windows he moved on down the street.</p>

<p>I saw that my only chance was to act at once.
I threw on my clothes, opened the window softly,
and, after making sure that there was nobody
about, dropped out on to the ground and made off
as hard as I could run. I travelled a matter of two
or three miles, when my wind gave out; and as I
saw a big building with people going in and out, I
went in too, and found that it was a railway station.
A train was just going off for Dover to meet the
French boat, so I took a ticket and jumped into a
third-class carriage.</p>

<p>There were a couple of other chaps in the
carriage, innocent-looking young beggars, both of
them. They began speaking about this and that,
while I sat quiet in the corner and listened. Then
they started on England and foreign countries, and
such like. Look ye now, Doctor, this is a fact.
One of them begins jawing about the justice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
England's laws. "It's all fair and above-board,"
says he; "there ain't any secret police, nor spying,
like they have abroad," and a lot more of the same
sort of wash. Rather rough on me, wasn't it,
listening to the damned young fool, with the police
following me about like my shadow?</p>

<p>I got to Paris right enough, and there I changed
some of my gold, and for a few days I imagined
I'd shaken them off, and began to think of settling
down for a bit of a rest. I needed it by that time,
for I was looking more like a ghost than a man.
You've never had the police after you, I suppose?
Well, you needn't look offended, I didn't mean any
harm. If ever you had you'd know that it wastes
a man away like a sheep with the rot.</p>

<p>I went to the opera one night and took a box,
for I was very flush. I was coming out between
the acts when I met a fellow lounging along in the
passage. The light fell on his face, and I saw that
it was the mud-pilot that had boarded us in the
Thames. His beard was gone, but I recognised
the man at a glance, for I've a good memory for
faces.</p>

<p>I tell you, Doctor, I felt desperate for a moment.
I could have knifed him if we had been alone, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
he knew me well enough never to give me the
chance. It was more than I could stand any
longer, so I went right up to him and drew him
aside, where we'd be free from all the loungers and
theatre-goers.</p>

<p>"How long are you going to keep it up?" I
asked him.</p>

<p>He seemed a bit flustered for a moment, but
then he saw there was no use beating about the
bush, so he answered straight&mdash;</p>

<p>"Until you go back to Australia," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't you know," I said, "that I have served
the Government and got a free pardon?"</p>

<p>He grinned all over his ugly face when I said
this.</p>

<p>"We know all about you, Maloney," he answered.
"If you want a quiet life, just you go back where
you came from. If you stay here, you're a marked
man; and when you are found tripping it'll be a
lifer for you, at the least. Free trade's a fine thing,
but the market's too full of men like you for us to
need to import any!"</p>

<p>It seemed to me that there was something in
what he said, though he had a nasty way of putting
it. For some days back I'd been feeling a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
home-sick. The ways of the people weren't my
ways. They stared at me in the street; and if I
dropped into a bar, they'd stop talking and edge
away a bit, as if I was a wild beast. I'd sooner
have had a pint of old Stringybark, too, than a
bucketful of their rotgut liquors. There was too
much damned propriety. What was the use of
having money if you couldn't dress as you liked,
nor bust it properly? There was no sympathy for
a man if he shot about a little when he was half-over.
I've seen a man dropped at Nelson many a
time with less row than they'd make over a broken
window-pane. The thing was slow, and I was sick
of it.</p>

<p>"You want me to go back?" I said.</p>

<p>"I've my orders to stick fast to you until you
do," he answered.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I don't care if I do. All I
bargain is that you keep your mouth shut, and
don't let on who I am, so that I may have a fair
start when I get there."</p>

<p>He agreed to this, and we went over to Southampton
the very next day, where he saw me safely
off once more. I took a passage round to Adelaide,
where no one was likely to know me; and there I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
settled, right under the nose of the police. I've
been there ever since, leading a quiet life, but for
little difficulties like the one I'm in for now, and
for that devil, Tattooed Tom of Hawkesbury. I
don't know what made me tell you all this, Doctor,
unless it is that being kind of lonely makes a man
inclined to jaw when he gets a chance. Just you
take warning from me, though. Never put yourself
out to serve your country; for your country
will do precious little for you. Just you let them
look after their own affairs; and if they find a
difficulty in hanging a set of scoundrels, never
mind chipping in, but let them alone to do as
best they can. Maybe they'll remember how they
treated me after I'm dead, and be sorry for
neglecting me. I was rude to you when you came
in, and swore a trifle promiscuous; but don't you
mind me, it's only my way. You'll allow, though,
that I have cause to be a bit touchy now and again
when I think of all that's passed. You're not
going, are you? Well, if you must, you must; but
I hope you will look me up at odd times when you
are going your round. Oh, I say, you've left the
balance of that cake of tobacco behind you, haven't
you? No; it's in your pocket&mdash;that's all right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Thank ye, Doctor, you're a good sort, and as quick
at a hint as any man I've met.</p>

<p>A couple of months after narrating his experiences,
Wolf Tone Maloney finished his term, and
was released. For a long time I neither saw him
nor heard of him; and he had almost slipped from
my memory, until I was reminded, in a somewhat
tragic manner, of his existence. I had been attending
a patient some distance off in the country, and
was riding back, guiding my tired horse among
the boulders which strewed the pathway, and
endeavouring to see my way through the gathering
darkness, when I came suddenly upon a little
wayside inn. As I walked my horse up towards
the door, intending to make sure of my bearings
before proceeding further, I heard the sound of a
violent altercation within the little bar. There
seemed to be a chorus of expostulation or remonstrance,
above which two powerful voices rang out
loud and angry. As I listened, there was a
momentary hush, two pistol shots sounded almost
simultaneously, and, with a crash, the door burst
open, and a pair of dark figures staggered out into
the moonlight. They struggled for a moment in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
deadly wrestle, and then went down together among
the loose stones. I had sprung off my horse, and,
with the help of half-a-dozen rough fellows from
the bar, dragged them away from one another.</p>

<p>A glance was sufficient to convince me that one
of them was dying fast. He was a thick-set, burly
fellow, with a determined cast of countenance.
The blood was welling from a deep stab in his
throat, and it was evident that an important artery
had been divided. I turned away from him in
despair, and walked over to where his antagonist
was lying. He was shot through the lungs, but
managed to raise himself upon his hand as I
approached, and peered anxiously up into my face.
To my surprise I saw before me the haggard
features and flaxen hair of my prison acquaintance,
Maloney.</p>

<p>"Ah, Doctor!" he said, recognising me. "How
is he? Will he die?"</p>

<p>He asked the question so earnestly that I
imagined he had softened at the last moment, and
feared to leave the world with another homicide
upon his conscience. Truth, however, compelled
me to shake my head mournfully, and to intimate
that the wound would prove a mortal one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Maloney gave a wild cry of triumph, which
brought the blood welling out from between his
lips. "Here, boys," he gasped to the little group
around him. "There's money in my inside pocket.
Damn the expense! Drinks round. There's
nothing mean about me. I'd drink with you, but
I'm going. Give the Doc. my share, for he's as
good&mdash;&mdash;" Here his head fell back with a thud,
his eye glazed, and the soul of Wolf Tone
Maloney, forger, convict, ranger, murderer, and
Government peach, drifted away into the Great
Unknown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I cannot conclude without borrowing the account
of the fatal quarrel which appeared in the columns
of the <i>West Australian Sentinel</i>. The curious will
find it in the issue of the 4th of October 1881:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fatal Affray.&mdash;W. T. Maloney, a well-known
citizen of New Montrose, and proprietor of the
Yellow Boy gambling saloon, has met with his
death under rather painful circumstances. Mr.
Maloney was a man who had led a chequered
existence, and whose past history is replete with
interest. Some of our readers may recall the
Lena Valley murders, in which he figured as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
principal criminal. It is conjectured that, during
the seven months that he owned a bar in that
region, from twenty to thirty travellers were
hocussed and made away with. He succeeded,
however, in evading the vigilance of the officers of
the law, and allied himself with the bushrangers
of Bluemansdyke, whose heroic capture and subsequent
execution are matters of history. Maloney
extricated himself from the fate which awaited him
by turning Queen's evidence. He afterwards
visited Europe, but returned to West Australia,
where he has long played a prominent part in local
matters. On Friday evening he encountered an
old enemy, Thomas Grimthorpe, commonly known
as Tattooed Tom of Hawkesbury. Shots were
exchanged, and both men were badly wounded,
only surviving a few minutes. Mr. Maloney had
the reputation of being, not only the most wholesale
murderer that ever lived, but also of having a
finish and attention to detail in matters of evidence
which has been unapproached by any European
criminal. <i>Sic transit gloriâ mundi!</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SILVER_HATCHET" id="THE_SILVER_HATCHET"><i>THE SILVER HATCHET.</i></a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class ="smcap">On</span> the 3rd of December 1861, Dr. Otto von
Hopstein, Regius Professor of Comparative Anatomy
of the University of Buda-Pesth, and Curator
of the Academical Museum, was foully and
brutally murdered within a stone-throw of the
entrance to the college quadrangle.</p>

<p>Besides the eminent position of the victim and
his popularity amongst both students and townsfolk,
there were other circumstances which excited
public interest very strongly, and drew general
attention throughout Austria and Hungary to this
murder. The <i>Pesther Abendblatt</i> of the following
day had an article upon it, which may still be
consulted by the curious, and from which I
translate a few passages giving a succinct account
of the circumstances under which the crime was
committed, and the peculiar features in the case
which puzzled the Hungarian police.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"It appears," said that very excellent paper,
"that Professor von Hopstein left the University
about half-past four in the afternoon, in order to
meet the train which is due from Vienna at three
minutes after five. He was accompanied by his
old and dear friend, Herr Wilhelm Schlessinger,
sub-Curator of the Museum and Privat-docent of
Chemistry. The object of these two gentlemen in
meeting this particular train was to receive the
legacy bequeathed by Graf von Schulling to the
University of Buda-Pesth. It is well known that
this unfortunate nobleman, whose tragic fate is still
fresh in the recollection of the public, left his
unique collection of mediæval weapons, as well as
several priceless black-letter editions, to enrich the
already celebrated museum of his Alma Mater.
The worthy Professor was too much of an
enthusiast in such matters to intrust the reception
or care of this valuable legacy to any subordinate;
and, with the assistance of Herr Schlessinger, he
succeeded in removing the whole collection from
the train, and stowing it away in a light cart which
had been sent by the University authorities. Most
of the books and more fragile articles were packed
in cases of pine-wood, but many of the weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
were simply done round with straw, so that considerable
labour was involved in moving them all.
The Professor was so nervous, however, lest any of
them should be injured, that he refused to allow
any of the railway employés (<i>Eisenbahn-diener</i>) to
assist. Every article was carried across the
platform by Herr Schlessinger, and handed to
Professor von Hopstein in the cart, who packed it
away. When everything was in, the two gentlemen,
still faithful to their charge, drove back to
the University, the Professor being in excellent
spirits, and not a little proud of the physical
exertion which he had shown himself capable of.
He made some joking allusion to it to Reinmaul,
the janitor, who, with his friend Schiffer, a
Bohemian Jew, met the cart on its return and
unloaded the contents. Leaving his curiosities
safe in the store-room, and locking the door, the
Professor handed the key to his sub-curator, and,
bidding every one good evening, departed in the
direction of his lodgings. Schlessinger took a last
look to reassure himself that all was right, and also
went off, leaving Reinmaul and his friend Schiffer
smoking in the janitor's lodge.</p>

<p>"At eleven o'clock, about an hour and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
after Von Hopstein's departure, a soldier of the
14th regiment of Jäger, passing the front of the
University on his way to barracks, came upon the
lifeless body of the Professor lying a little way
from the side of the road. He had fallen upon his
face, with both hands stretched out. His head
was literally split in two halves by a tremendous
blow, which, it is conjectured, must have been
struck from behind, there remaining a peaceful
smile upon the old man's face, as if he had been still
dwelling upon his new archæological acquisition
when death had overtaken him. There is no other
mark of violence upon the body, except a bruise
over the left patella, caused probably by the fall.
The most mysterious part of the affair is that the
Professor's purse, containing forty-three gulden,
and his valuable watch have been untouched.
Robbery cannot, therefore, have been the incentive
to the deed, unless the assassins were disturbed
before they could complete their work.</p>

<p>"This idea is negatived by the fact that the
body must have lain at least an hour before any
one discovered it. The whole affair is wrapped in
mystery. Dr. Langemann, the eminent medico-jurist,
has pronounced that the wound is such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
might have been inflicted by a heavy sword-bayonet
wielded by a powerful arm. The police
are extremely reticent upon the subject, and it is
suspected that they are in possession of a clue
which may lead to important results."</p>

<p>Thus far the <i>Pesther Abendblatt</i>. The researches
of the police failed, however, to throw
the least glimmer of light upon the matter. There
was absolutely no trace of the murderer, nor could
any amount of ingenuity invent any reason which
could have induced any one to commit the
dreadful deed. The deceased Professor was a
man so wrapped in his own studies and pursuits
that he lived apart from the world, and had certainly
never raised the slightest animosity in any
human breast. It must have been some fiend,
some savage, who loved blood for its own sake,
who struck that merciless blow.</p>

<p>Though the officials were unable to come to any
conclusions upon the matter, popular suspicion
was not long in pitching upon a scapegoat. In
the first published accounts of the murder the
name of one Schiffer had been mentioned as
having remained with the janitor after the Professor's
departure. This man was a Jew, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Jews have never been popular in Hungary. A
cry was at once raised for Schiffer's arrest; but
as there was not the slightest grain of evidence
against him, the authorities very properly refused
to consent to so arbitrary a proceeding. Reinmaul,
who was an old and most respected citizen, declared
solemnly that Schiffer was with him until
the startled cry of the soldier had caused them
both to run out to the scene of the tragedy.
No one ever dreamed of implicating Reinmaul
in such a matter; but still, it was rumoured that
his ancient and well-known friendship for Schiffer
might have induced him to tell a falsehood in
order to screen him. Popular feeling ran very
high upon the subject, and there seemed a danger
of Schiffer's being mobbed in the street, when an
incident occurred which threw a very different
light upon the matter.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th of December, just
nine days after the mysterious murder of the Professor,
Schiffer the Bohemian Jew was found lying
in the north-western corner of the Grand Platz
stone dead, and so mutilated that he was hardly
recognisable. His head was cloven open in very
much the same way as that of Von Hopstein, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
his body exhibited numerous deep gashes, as if the
murderer had been so carried away and transported
with fury that he had continued to hack the
lifeless body. Snow had fallen heavily the day
before, and was lying at least a foot deep all over
the square; some had fallen during the night, too,
as was evidenced by a thin layer lying like a
winding-sheet over the murdered man. It was
hoped at first that this circumstance might assist
in giving a clue by enabling the footsteps of the
assassin to be traced; but the crime had been
committed, unfortunately, in a place much frequented
during the day, and there were innumerable
tracks in every direction. Besides, the newly-fallen
snow had blurred the footsteps to such an
extent that it would have been impossible to draw
trustworthy evidence from them.</p>

<p>In this case there was exactly the same impenetrable
mystery and absence of motive which had
characterised the murder of Professor von Hopstein.
In the dead man's pocket there was found a note-book
containing a considerable sum in gold and
several very valuable bills, but no attempt had
been made to rifle him. Supposing that any one
to whom he had lent money (and this was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
first idea which occurred to the police) had taken
this means of evading his debt, it was hardly conceivable
that he would have left such a valuable
spoil untouched. Schiffer lodged with a widow
named Gruga, at 49 Marie Theresa Strasse, and
the evidence of his landlady and her children
showed that he had remained shut up in his room
the whole of the preceding day in a state of deep
dejection, caused by the suspicion which the populace
had fastened upon him. She had heard him
go out about eleven o'clock at night for his last
and fatal walk, and as he had a latch-key she had
gone to bed without waiting for him. His object
in choosing such a late hour for a ramble obviously
was that he did not consider himself safe if recognised
in the streets.</p>

<p>The occurrence of this second murder so shortly
after the first threw not only the town of Buda-Pesth,
but the whole of Hungary, into a terrible
state of excitement, and even of terror. Vague
dangers seemed to hang over the head of every
man. The only parallel to this intense feeling was
to be found in our own country at the time of the
Williams murders described by De Quincey. There
were so many resemblances between the cases of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Von Hopstein and of Schiffer that no one could
doubt that there existed a connection between the
two. The absence of object and of robbery, the
utter want of any clue to the assassin, and, lastly,
the ghastly nature of the wounds, evidently inflicted
by the same or a similar weapon, all
pointed in one direction. Things were in this
state when the incidents which I am now about
to relate occurred, and in order to make them
intelligible I must lead up to them from a fresh
point of departure.</p>

<p>Otto von Schlegel was a younger son of the
old Silesian family of that name. His father had
originally destined him for the army, but at the
advice of his teachers, who saw the surprising
talent of the youth, had sent him to the University
of Buda-Pesth to be educated in medicine. Here
young Schlegel carried everything before him,
and promised to be one of the most brilliant
graduates turned out for many a year. Though
a hard reader, he was no bookworm, but an active,
powerful young fellow, full of animal spirits and
vivacity, and extremely popular among his fellow-students.</p>

<p>The New Year examinations were at hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Schlegel was working hard&mdash;so hard that even
the strange murders in the town, and the general
excitement in men's minds, failed to turn his
thoughts from his studies. Upon Christmas Eve,
when every house was illuminated, and the roar
of drinking songs came from the Bierkeller in
the Student-quartier, he refused the many invitations
to roystering suppers which were showered
upon him, and went off with his books under his
arm to the rooms of Leopold Strauss, to work with
him into the small hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Strauss and Schlegel were bosom friends. They
were both Silesians, and had known each other
from boyhood. Their affection had become proverbial
in the University. Strauss was almost as
distinguished a student as Schlegel, and there
had been many a tough struggle for academic
honours between the two fellow-countrymen, which
had only served to strengthen their friendship by
a bond of mutual respect. Schlegel admired the
dogged pluck and never-failing good temper of his
old playmate; while the latter considered Schlegel,
with his many talents and brilliant versatility, the
most accomplished of mortals.</p>

<p>The friends were still working together, the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
reading from a volume on anatomy, the other
holding a skull and marking off the various parts
mentioned in the text, when the deep-toned bell
of St. Gregory's church struck the hour of midnight.</p>

<p>"Hark to that!" said Schlegel, snapping up the
book and stretching out his long legs towards the
cheery fire. "Why, it's Christmas morning, old
friend! May it not be the last that we spend
together!"</p>

<p>"May we have passed all these confounded
examinations before another one comes!" answered
Strauss. "But see here, Otto, one bottle
of wine will not be amiss. I have laid one up
on purpose;" and with a smile on his honest
South German face, he pulled out a long-necked
bottle of Rhenish from amongst a pile of books
and bones in the corner.</p>

<p>"It is a night to be comfortable indoors," said
Otto von Schlegel, looking out at the snowy
landscape, "for 'tis bleak and bitter enough outside.
Good health, Leopold!"</p>

<p>"<i>Lebe hoch!</i>" replied his companion. "It is a
comfort indeed to forget sphenoid bones and
ethmoid bones, if it be but for a moment. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
what is the news of the corps, Otto? Has
Graube fought the Swabian?"</p>

<p>"They fight to-morrow," said Von Schlegel.
"I fear that our man will lose his beauty, for he
is short in the arm. Yet activity and skill may
do much for him. They say his hanging guard
is perfection."</p>

<p>"And what else is the news amongst the
students?" asked Strauss.</p>

<p>"They talk, I believe, of nothing but the
murders. But I have worked hard of late, as
you know, and hear little of the gossip."</p>

<p>"Have you had time," inquired Strauss, "to look
over the books and the weapons which our dear old
Professor was so concerned about the very day he met
his death? They say they are well worth a visit."</p>

<p>"I saw them to-day," said Schlegel, lighting his
pipe. "Reinmaul, the janitor, showed me over
the store-room, and I helped to label many of
them from the original catalogue of Graf Schulling's
museum. As far as we can see, there is but one
article missing of all the collection."</p>

<p>"One missing!" exclaimed Strauss. "That
would grieve old Von Hopstein's ghost. Is it
anything of value?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is described as an antique hatchet, with a
head of steel and a handle of chased silver. We
have applied to the railway company, and no
doubt it will be found."</p>

<p>"I trust so," echoed Strauss; and the conversation
drifted off into other channels. The fire was
burning low and the bottle of Rhenish was empty
before the two friends rose from their chairs, and
Von Schlegel prepared to depart.</p>

<p>"Ugh! It's a bitter night!" he said, standing
on the doorstep and folding his cloak round him.
"Why, Leopold, you have your cap on. You are
not going out, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am coming with you," said Strauss,
shutting the door behind him. "I feel heavy," he
continued, taking his friend's arm, and walking
down the street with him. "I think a walk as far
as your lodgings, in the crisp frosty air, is just the
thing to set me right."</p>

<p>The two students went down Stephen Strasse
together and across Julien Platz, talking on a
variety of topics. As they passed the corner of
the Grand Platz, however, where Schiffer had been
found dead, the conversation turned naturally upon
the murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's where they found him," remarked Von
Schlegel, pointing to the fatal spot.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the murderer is near us now," said
Strauss. "Let us hasten on."</p>

<p>They both turned to go, when Von Schlegel
gave a sudden cry of pain and stooped down.</p>

<p>"Something has cut through my boot!" he
cried; and feeling about with his hand in the
snow, he pulled out a small glistening battle-axe,
made apparently entirely of metal. It had been
lying with the blade turned slightly upwards, so
as to cut the foot of the student when he trod
upon it.</p>

<p>"The weapon of the murderer!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>"The silver hatchet from the museum!" cried
Strauss in the same breath.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that it was both the
one and the other. There could not be two such
curious weapons, and the character of the wounds
was just such as would be inflicted by a similar
instrument. The murderer had evidently thrown
it aside after committing the dreadful deed, and
it had lain concealed in the snow some twenty
mètres from the spot ever since. It was extraordinary
that of all the people who had passed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
repassed none had discovered it; but the snow
was deep, and it was a little off the beaten track.</p>

<p>"What are we to do with it?" said Von
Schlegel, holding it in his hand. He shuddered
as he noticed by the light of the moon that the
head of it was all dabbled with dark-brown stains.</p>

<p>"Take it to the Commissary of Police," suggested
Strauss.</p>

<p>"He'll be in bed now. Still, I think you are
right. But it is nearly four o'clock. I will wait
until morning, and take it round before breakfast.
Meanwhile, I must carry it with me to my
lodgings."</p>

<p>"That is the best plan," said his friend; and
the two walked on together talking of the remarkable
find which they had made. When they
came to Schlegel's door, Strauss said good-bye,
refusing an invitation to go in, and walked briskly
down the street in the direction of his own
lodgings.</p>

<p>Schlegel was stooping down putting the key
into the lock, when a strange change came over
him. He trembled violently, and dropped the
key from his quivering fingers. His right hand
closed convulsively round the handle of the silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
hatchet, and his eye followed the retreating figure
of his friend with a vindictive glare. In spite of
the coldness of the night the perspiration streamed
down his face. For a moment he seemed to
struggle with himself, holding his hand up to his
throat as if he were suffocating. Then, with
crouching body and rapid, noiseless steps, he crept
after his late companion.</p>

<p>Strauss was plodding sturdily along through the
snow, humming snatches of a student song, and
little dreaming of the dark figure which pursued
him. At the Grand Platz it was forty yards
behind him; at the Julien Platz it was but twenty;
in Stephen Strasse it was ten, and gaining on him
with panther-like rapidity. Already it was almost
within arm's length of the unsuspecting man, and
the hatchet glittered coldly in the moonlight, when
some slight noise must have reached Strauss's ears,
for he faced suddenly round upon his pursuer.
He started and uttered an exclamation as his eye
met the white set face, with flashing eyes and
clenched teeth, which seemed to be suspended in
the air behind him.</p>

<p>"What, Otto!" he exclaimed, recognising his
friend. "Art thou ill? You look pale. Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
with me to my&mdash;&mdash; Ah! hold, you madman, hold!
Drop that axe! Drop it, I say, or by heaven I'll
choke you!"</p>

<p>Von Schlegel had thrown himself upon him with
a wild cry and uplifted weapon; but the student
was stout-hearted and resolute. He rushed inside
the sweep of the hatchet and caught his assailant
round the waist, narrowly escaping a blow which
would have cloven his head. The two staggered
for a moment in a deadly wrestle, Schlegel
endeavouring to shorten his weapon; but Strauss
with a desperate wrench managed to bring him to
the ground, and they rolled together in the snow,
Strauss clinging to the other's right arm and
shouting frantically for assistance. It was as well
that he did so, for Schlegel would certainly have
succeeded in freeing his arm had it not been for
the arrival of two stalwart gendarmes, attracted by
the uproar. Even then the three of them found
it difficult to overcome the maniacal strength of
Schlegel, and they were utterly unable to wrench
the silver hatchet from his grasp. One of the
gendarmes, however, had a coil of rope round his
waist, with which he rapidly secured the student's
arms to his sides. In this way, half pushed, half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
dragged, he was conveyed, in spite of furious cries
and frenzied struggles, to the central police station.</p>

<p>Strauss assisted in coercing his former friend, and
accompanied the police to the station; protesting
loudly at the same time against any unnecessary
violence, and giving it as his opinion that a lunatic
asylum would be a more fitting place for the
prisoner. The events of the last half-hour had
been so sudden and inexplicable that he felt quite
dazed himself. What did it all mean? It was
certain that his old friend from boyhood had
attempted to murder him, and had nearly succeeded.
Was Von Schlegel then the murderer of
Professor von Hopstein and of the Bohemian Jew?
Strauss felt that it was impossible, for the Jew
was not even known to him, and the Professor
had been his especial favourite. He followed
mechanically to the police station, lost in grief and
amazement.</p>

<p>Inspector Baumgarten, one of the most energetic
and best known of the police officials, was on duty
in the absence of the Commissary. He was a
wiry little active man, quiet and retiring in his
habits, but possessed of great sagacity and a
vigilance which never relaxed. Now, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
had had a six hours' vigil, he sat as erect as ever,
with his pen behind his ear, at his official desk,
while his friend, Sub-inspector Winkel, snored in a
chair at the side of the stove. Even the inspector's
usually immovable features betrayed surprise, however,
when the door was flung open and Von
Schlegel was dragged in with pale face and
disordered clothes, the silver hatchet still grasped
firmly in his hand. Still more surprised was he
when Strauss and the gendarmes gave their
account, which was duly entered in the official
register.</p>

<p>"Young man, young man," said Inspector
Baumgarten, laying down his pen and fixing his
eyes sternly upon the prisoner, "this is pretty
work for Christmas morning; why have you done
this thing?"</p>

<p>"God knows!" cried Von Schlegel, covering
his face with his hands and dropping the hatchet.
A change had come over him, his fury and excitement
were gone, and he seemed utterly prostrated
with grief.</p>

<p>"You have rendered yourself liable to a strong
suspicion of having committed the other murders
which have disgraced our city."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, indeed!" said Von Schlegel earnestly.
"God forbid!"</p>

<p>"At least you are guilty of attempting the life
of Herr Leopold Strauss."</p>

<p>"The dearest friend I have in the world,"
groaned the student. "Oh, how could I! How
could I!"</p>

<p>"His being your friend makes your crime ten
times more heinous," said the inspector severely.
"Remove him for the remainder of the night to
the&mdash;&mdash; But steady! Who comes here?"</p>

<p>The door was pushed open, and a man came
into the room, so haggard and careworn that he
looked more like a ghost than a human being.
He tottered as he walked, and had to clutch at
the backs of the chairs as he approached the
inspector's desk. It was hard to recognise in this
miserable-looking object the once cheerful and
rubicund sub-curator of the museum and privat-docent
of chemistry, Herr Wilhelm Schlessinger.
The practised eye of Baumgarten, however, was
not to be baffled by any change.</p>

<p>"Good morning, mein herr," he said; "you are
up early. No doubt the reason is that you have
heard that one of your students, Von Schlegel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
is arrested for attempting the life of Leopold
Strauss?"</p>

<p>"No; I have come for myself," said Schlessinger,
speaking huskily, and putting his hand up to his
throat. "I have come to ease my soul of the
weight of a great sin, though, God knows, an
unmeditated one. It was I who&mdash;&mdash; But, merciful
heavens! there it is&mdash;the horrid thing! Oh, that I
had never seen it!"</p>

<p>He shrank back in a paroxysm of terror, glaring
at the silver hatchet where it lay upon the floor,
and pointing at it with his emaciated hand.</p>

<p>"There it lies!" he yelled. "Look at it! It
has come to condemn me. See that brown rust
on it! Do you know what that is? That is the
blood of my dearest, best friend, Professor von
Hopstein. I saw it gush over the very handle as
I drove the blade through his brain. Mein Gott, I
see it now!"</p>

<p>"Sub-inspector Winkel," said Baumgarten, endeavouring
to preserve his official austerity, "you
will arrest this man, charged on his own confession
with the murder of the late Professor. I also
deliver into your hands Von Schlegel here,
charged with a murderous assault upon Herr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Strauss. You will also keep this hatchet"&mdash;here
he picked it from the floor&mdash;"which has apparently
been used for both crimes."</p>

<p>Wilhelm Schlessinger had been leaning against
the table, with a face of ashy paleness. As the
inspector ceased speaking, he looked up excitedly.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" he cried. "Von Schlegel
attack Strauss! The two dearest friends in the
college! I slay my old master! It is magic, I
say; it is a charm! There is a spell upon us! It
is&mdash;Ah, I have it! It is that hatchet&mdash;that thrice
accursed hatchet!" and he pointed convulsively at
the weapon which Inspector Baumgarten still held
in his hand.</p>

<p>The inspector smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Restrain yourself, mein herr," he said. "You
do but make your case worse by such wild excuses
for the wicked deed you confess to. Magic and
charms are not known in the legal vocabulary, as
my friend Winkel will assure you."</p>

<p>"I know not," remarked his sub-inspector,
shrugging his broad shoulders. "There are many
strange things in the world. Who knows but
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" roared Inspector Baumgarten furiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
"You would undertake to contradict me! You
would set up your opinion! You would be the
champion of these accursed murderers! Fool,
miserable fool, your hour has come!" and rushing
at the astounded Winkel, he dealt a blow at him
with the silver hatchet which would certainly have
justified his last assertion had it not been that, in
his fury, he overlooked the lowness of the rafters
above his head. The blade of the hatchet struck
one of these, and remained there quivering, while
the handle was splintered into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>"What have I done?" gasped Baumgarten,
falling back into his chair. "What have I done?"</p>

<p>"You have proved Herr Schlessinger's words to
be correct," said Von Schlegel, stepping forward,
for the astonished policemen had let go their grasp
of him. "That is what you have done. Against
reason, science, and everything else though it be,
there is a charm at work. There must be!
Strauss, old boy, you know I would not, in my
right senses, hurt one hair of your head. And
you, Schlessinger, we both know you loved
the old man who is dead. And you, Inspector
Baumgarten, you would not willingly have struck
your friend the sub-inspector?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not for the whole world," groaned the inspector,
covering his face with his hands.</p>

<p>"Then is it not clear? But now, thank Heaven,
the accursed thing is broken, and can never do
harm again. But see, what is that?"</p>

<p>Right in the centre of the room was lying a thin
brown cylinder of parchment. One glance at the
fragments of the handle of the weapon showed
that it had been hollow. This roll of paper had
apparently been hidden away inside the metal
case thus formed, having been introduced through
a small hole, which had been afterwards soldered
up. Von Schlegel opened the document. The
writing upon it was almost illegible from age; but
as far as they could make out it stood thus, in
mediæval German&mdash;</p>

<p>"Diese Waffe benutzte Max von Erlichingen um
Joanna Bodeck zu ermorden, deshalb beschuldige
Ich, Johann Bodeck, mittelst der macht welche
mir als mitglied des Concils des rothen Kreuzes
verliehan wurde, dieselbe mit dieser unthat. Mag
sie anderen denselben schmerz verursachen den
sie mir verursacht hat. Mag Jede hand die
sie ergreift mit dem blut eines freundes geröthet
sein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Which may be roughly translated&mdash;</p>

<p>"This weapon was used by Max von Erlichingen
for the murder of Joanna Bodeck. Therefore do I,
Johann Bodeck, accurse it by the power which has
been bequeathed to me as one of the Council of
the Rosy Cross. May it deal to others the grief
which it has dealt to me! May every hand that
grasps it be reddened in the blood of a friend!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220; &#8216;Ever evil, never good,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Reddened with a loved one&#8217;s blood.&#8217; &#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was a dead silence in the room when Von
Schlegel had finished spelling out this strange
document. As he put it down Strauss laid his
hand affectionately upon his arm.</p>

<p>"No such proof is needed by me, old friend," he
said. "At the very moment that you struck at
me I forgave you in my heart. I well know that if
the poor Professor were in the room he would say
as much to Herr Wilhelm Schlessinger."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," remarked the inspector, standing
up and resuming his official tones, "this affair,
strange as it is, must be treated according to rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and precedent. Sub-inspector Winkel, as your
superior officer, I command you to arrest me upon
a charge of murderously assaulting you. You will
commit me to prison for the night, together with
Herr von Schlegel and Herr Wilhelm Schlessinger.
We shall take our trial at the coming sitting of
the judges. In the meantime take care of that
piece of evidence"&mdash;pointing to the piece of
parchment&mdash;"and, while I am away, devote your
time and energy to utilising the clue you have
obtained in discovering who it was who slew Herr
Schiffer, the Bohemian Jew."</p>

<p>The one missing link in the chain of evidence
was soon supplied. On the 28th of December the
wife of Reinmaul the janitor, coming into the bedroom
after a short absence, found her husband
hanging lifeless from a hook in the wall. He had
tied a long bolster-case round his neck and stood
upon a chair in order to commit the fatal deed.
On the table was a note in which he confessed to
the murder of Schiffer the Jew, adding that the
deceased had been his oldest friend, and that he
had slain him without premeditation, in obedience
to some incontrollable impulse. Remorse and
grief, he said, had driven him to self-destruction;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and he wound up his confession by commending
his soul to the mercy of Heaven.</p>

<p>The trial which ensued was one of the strangest
which ever occurred in the whole history of jurisprudence.
It was in vain that the prosecuting
council urged the improbability of the explanation
offered by the prisoners, and deprecated the
introduction of such an element as magic into a
nineteenth-century law-court. The chain of facts
was too strong, and the prisoners were unanimously
acquitted. "This silver hatchet," remarked
the judge in his summing up, "has hung untouched
upon the wall in the mansion of the Graf von
Schulling for nearly two hundred years. The
shocking manner in which he met his death at the
hands of his favourite house steward is still fresh
in your recollection. It has come out in evidence
that, a few days before the murder, the steward had
overhauled the old weapons and cleaned them.
In doing this he must have touched the handle of
this hatchet. Immediately afterwards he slew his
master, whom he had served faithfully for twenty
years. The weapon then came, in conformity with
the Count's will, to Buda-Pesth, where, at the
station, Herr Wilhelm Schlessinger grasped it, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
within two hours, used it against the person of the
deceased Professor. The next man whom we
find touching it is the janitor Reinmaul, who
helped to remove the weapons from the cart to the
store-room. At the first opportunity he buried it
in the body of his friend Schiffer. We then have
the attempted murder of Strauss by Schlegel, and
of Winkel by Inspector Baumgarten, all immediately
following the taking of the hatchet into the
hand. Lastly, comes the providential discovery of
the extraordinary document which has been read
to you by the clerk of the court. I invite your
most careful consideration, gentlemen of the jury,
to this chain of facts, knowing that you will find a
verdict according to your consciences without fear
and without favour."</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting piece of evidence to
the English reader, though it found few supporters
among the Hungarian audience, was that of Dr.
Langemann, the eminent medico-jurist, who has
written text-books upon metallurgy and toxicology.
He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am not so sure, gentlemen, that there is need
to fall back upon necromancy or the black art for
an explanation of what has occurred. What I say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
is merely a hypothesis, without proof of any sort,
but in a case so extraordinary every suggestion
may be of value. The Rosicrucians, to whom
allusion is made in this paper, were the most
profound chemists of the early Middle Ages, and
included the principal alchemists whose names
have descended to us. Much as chemistry has
advanced, there are some points in which the
ancients were ahead of us, and in none more so
than in the manufacture of poisons of subtle and
deadly action. This man Bodeck, as one of the
elders of the Rosicrucians, possessed, no doubt, the
recipe of many such mixtures, some of which, like
the <i>aqua tofana</i> of the Medicis, would poison by
penetrating through the pores of the skin. It is
conceivable that the handle of this silver hatchet
has been anointed by some preparation which is
a diffusible poison, having the effect upon the
human body of bringing on sudden and acute
attacks of homicidal mania. In such attacks it is
well known that the madman's rage is turned
against those whom he loved best when sane. I
have, as I remarked before, no proof to support me
in my theory, and simply put it forward for what it
is worth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>With this extract from the speech of the learned
and ingenious professor, we may close the account
of this famous trial.</p>

<p>The broken pieces of the silver hatchet were
thrown into a deep pond, a clever poodle being
employed to carry them in his mouth, as no one
would touch them for fear some of the infection
might still hang about them. The piece of parchment
was preserved in the museum of the University.
As to Strauss and Schlegel, Winkel and
Baumgarten, they continued the best of friends,
and are so still for all I know to the contrary.
Schlessinger became surgeon of a cavalry regiment;
and was shot at the battle of Sadowa five years
later, while rescuing the wounded under a heavy
fire. By his last injunctions his little patrimony
was to be sold to erect a marble obelisk over the
grave of Professor von Hopstein.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAN_FROM_ARCHANGEL" id="THE_MAN_FROM_ARCHANGEL"><i>THE MAN FROM ARCHANGEL.</i></a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class ="smcap">On</span> the fourth day of March, in the year 1867, I
being at that time in my five-and-twentieth year, I
wrote the following words in my note-book, the
result of much mental perturbation and conflict:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The solar system, amidst a countless number
of other systems as large as itself, rolls ever silently
through space in the direction of the constellation
of Hercules. The great spheres of which it is
composed spin and spin through the eternal void
ceaselessly and noiselessly. Of these one of the
smallest and most insignificant is that conglomeration
of solid and of liquid particles which we have
named the earth. It whirls onwards now as it has
done before my birth, and will do after my death&mdash;a
revolving mystery, coming none know whence,
and going none know whither. Upon the outer
crust of this moving mass crawl many mites, of
whom I, John McVittie, am one, helpless, impotent,
being dragged aimlessly through space. Yet such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
is the state of things amongst us that the little
energy and glimmering of reason which I possess
is entirely taken up with the labours which are
necessary in order to procure certain metallic
disks, wherewith I may purchase the chemical
elements necessary to build up my ever-wasting
tissues, and keep a roof over me to shelter me
from the inclemency of the weather. I thus have
no thought to expend upon the vital questions
which surround me on every side. Yet, miserable
entity as I am, I can still at times feel some
degree of happiness, and am even&mdash;save the mark!&mdash;puffed
up occasionally with a sense of my own
importance."</p>

<p>These words, as I have said, I wrote down in
my note-book, and they reflected accurately the
thoughts which I found rooted far down in my
soul, ever present and unaffected by the passing
emotions of the hour. Every day for seven
months I read over my words, and every day
when I had finished them I said to myself, "Well
done, John McVittie; you have said the thought
which was in you. You have reduced things to their
least common measure!" At last came a time when
my uncle, McVittie of Glencairn, died&mdash;the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
who was at one time chairman of committees of
the House of Commons. He divided his great
wealth among his many nephews, and I found
myself with sufficient to provide amply for my
wants during the remainder of my life, and became
at the same time owner of a bleak tract of land
upon the coast of Caithness, which I think the old
man must have bestowed upon me in derision, for
it was sandy and valueless, and he had ever a grim
sense of humour. Up to this time I had been an
attorney in a midland town in England. Now I
saw that I could put my thoughts into effect, and,
leaving all petty and sordid aims, could elevate my
mind by the study of the secrets of nature. My
departure from my English home was somewhat
accelerated by the fact that I had nearly slain a
man in a quarrel, for my temper was fiery, and I
was apt to forget my own strength when enraged.
There was no legal action taken in the matter, but
the papers yelped at me, and folk looked askance
when I met them. It ended by my cursing them
and their vile, smoke-polluted town, and hurrying
to my northern possession, where I might at last
find peace and an opportunity for solitary study
and contemplation. I borrowed from my capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
before I went, and so was able to take with me a
choice collection of the most modern philosophical
instruments and books, together with chemicals
and such other things as I might need in my
retirement.</p>

<p>The land which I had inherited was a narrow
strip, consisting mostly of sand, and extending for
rather over two miles round the coast of Mansie
Bay, in Caithness. Upon this strip there had been
a rambling, grey-stone building&mdash;when erected or
wherefore none could tell me&mdash;and this I had
repaired, so that it made a dwelling quite good
enough for one of my simple tastes. One room
was my laboratory, another my sitting-room, and
in a third, just under the sloping roof, I slung the
hammock in which I always slept. There were
three other rooms, but I left them vacant, except
one which was given over to the old crone who
kept house for me. Save the Youngs and the
McLeods, who were fisher-folk living round at the
other side of Fergus Ness, there were no other
people for many miles in each direction. In front
of the house was the great bay, behind it were two
long barren hills, capped by other loftier ones
beyond. There was a glen between the hills, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
when the wind was from the land it used to sweep
down this with a melancholy sough and whisper
among the branches of the fir trees beneath my
attic window.</p>

<p>I dislike my fellow-mortals. Justice compels me
to add that they appear for the most part to dislike
me. I hate their little crawling ways, their
conventionalities, their deceits, their narrow rights
and wrongs. They take offence at my brusque
outspokenness, my disregard for their social laws,
my impatience of all constraint. Among my books
and my drugs in my lonely den at Mansie I could
let the great drove of the human race pass onwards
with their politics and inventions and tittle-tattle,
and I remained behind stagnant and happy. Not
stagnant either, for I was working in my own little
groove, and making progress. I have reason to
believe that Dalton's atomic theory is founded
upon error, and I know that mercury is not an
element.</p>

<p>During the day I was busy with my distillations
and analyses. Often I forgot my meals, and when
old Madge summoned me to my tea I found my
dinner lying untouched upon the table. At night
I read Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant&mdash;all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
who have pried into what is unknowable. They
are all fruitless and empty, barren of result, but
prodigal of polysyllables, reminding me of men
who while digging for gold have turned up many
worms, and then exhibit them exultantly as being
what they sought. At times a restless spirit
would come upon me, and I would walk thirty and
forty miles without rest or breaking fast. On
these occasions, when I used to stalk through the
country villages, gaunt, unshaven, and dishevelled,
the mothers would rush into the road and drag
their children indoors, and the rustics would
swarm out of their pot-houses to gaze at me. I
believe that I was known far and wide as the
"mad laird o' Mansie." It was rarely, however,
that I made these raids into the country, for I
usually took my exercise upon my own beach,
where I soothed my spirit with strong black
tobacco, and made the ocean my friend and my
confidant.</p>

<p>What companion is there like the great restless,
throbbing sea? What human mood is there which
it does not match and sympathise with? There
are none so gay but that they may feel gayer when
they listen to its merry turmoil, and see the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
green surges racing in, with the glint of the sunbeams
in their sparkling crests. But when the
grey waves toss their heads in anger, and the
wind screams above them, goading them on to
madder and more tumultuous efforts, then the
darkest-minded of men feels that there is a melancholy
principle in Nature which is as gloomy as
his own thoughts. When it was calm in the Bay of
Mansie the surface would be as clear and bright
as a sheet of silver, broken only at one spot some
little way from the shore, where a long black line
projected out of the water looking like the jagged
back of some sleeping monster. This was the
top of the dangerous ridge of rocks known to
the fishermen as the "ragged reef o' Mansie."
When the wind blew from the east the waves
would break upon it like thunder, and the spray
would be tossed far over my house and up to
the hills behind. The bay itself was a bold and
noble one, but too much exposed to the northern
and eastern gales, and too much dreaded for its
reef, to be much used by mariners. There was
something of romance about this lonely spot. I
have lain in my boat upon a calm day, and, peering
over the edge, I have seen far down the flickering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
ghostly forms of great fish&mdash;fish, as it seemed to
me, such as naturalists never knew, and which
my imagination transformed into the genii of that
desolate bay. Once, as I stood by the brink of
the waters upon a quiet night, a great cry, as of
a woman in hopeless grief, rose from the bosom
of the deep, and swelled out upon the still air,
now sinking and now rising, for a space of thirty
seconds. This I heard with my own ears.</p>

<p>In this strange spot, with the eternal hills behind
me and the eternal sea in front, I worked and
brooded for more than two years unpestered by
my fellow-men. By degrees I had trained my
old servant into habits of silence, so that she now
rarely opened her lips, though I doubt not that
when twice a year she visited her relations in
Wick, her tongue during those few days made
up for its enforced rest. I had come almost to
forget that I was a member of the human family,
and to live entirely with the dead whose books
I pored over, when a sudden incident occurred
which threw all my thoughts into a new channel.</p>

<p>Three rough days in June had been succeeded
by one calm and peaceful one. There was not
a breath of air that evening. The sun sank down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in the west behind a line of purple clouds, and
the smooth surface of the bay was gashed with
scarlet streaks. Along the beach the pools left
by the tide showed up like gouts of blood against
the yellow sand, as if some wounded giant had
toilfully passed that way, and had left these red
traces of his grievous hurt behind him. As the
darkness closed in, certain ragged clouds which
had lain low on the eastern horizon coalesced
and formed a great irregular cumulus. The glass
was still low, and I knew that there was mischief
brewing. About nine o'clock a dull moaning
sound came up from the sea, as from a creature
who, much harassed, learns that the hour of suffering
has come round again. At ten a sharp breeze
sprang up from the eastward. At eleven it had
increased to a gale, and by midnight the most
furious storm was raging which I ever remember
upon that weather-beaten coast.</p>

<p>As I went to bed the shingle and sea-weed
was pattering up against my attic-window, and
the wind was screaming as though every gust
were a lost soul. By that time the sounds of the
tempest had become a lullaby to me. I knew
that the grey walls of the old house would buffet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
it out, and for what occurred in the world outside
I had small concern. Old Madge was usually
as callous to such things as I was myself. It
was a surprise to me when, about three in the
morning, I was awoke by the sound of a great
knocking at my door and excited cries in the
wheezy voice of my housekeeper. I sprang out
of my hammock, and roughly demanded of her
what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Eh, maister, maister!" she screamed in her
hateful dialect. "Come doun, mun; come doun!
There's a muckle ship gaun ashore on the reef,
and the puir folks are a' yammerin' and ca'in'
for help&mdash;and I doobt they'll a' be drooned. Oh,
Maister McVittie, come doun!"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you hag!" I shouted back
in a passion. "What is it to you whether they
are drowned or not? Get back to your bed and
leave me alone." I turned in again, and drew the
blankets over me. "Those men out there," I
said to myself, "have already gone through half
the horrors of death. If they be saved they will
but have to go through the same once more in
the space of a few brief years. It is best, therefore,
that they should pass away now, since they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
have suffered that anticipation which is more
than the pain of dissolution." With this thought
in my mind I endeavoured to compose myself to
sleep once more, for that philosophy which had
taught me to consider death as a small and trivial
incident in man's eternal and ever-changing career,
had also broken me of much curiosity concerning
worldly matters. On this occasion I found, however,
that the old leaven still fermented strongly in
my soul. I tossed from side to side for some
minutes endeavouring to beat down the impulses
of the moment by the rules of conduct which I had
framed during months of thought. Then I heard
a dull roar amid the wild shriek of the gale, and
I knew that it was the sound of a signal-gun.
Driven by an uncontrollable impulse, I rose,
dressed, and, having lit my pipe, walked out on
to the beach.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark when I came outside, and the
wind blew with such violence that I had to put
my shoulder against it and push my way along
the shingle. My face pringled and smarted with
the sting of the gravel which was blown against
it, and the red ashes of my pipe streamed away
behind me dancing fantastically through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
darkness. I went down to where the great waves
were thundering in, and, shading my eyes with
my hand to keep off the salt spray, I peered out
to sea. I could distinguish nothing, and yet it
seemed to me that shouts and great inarticulate
cries were borne to me by the blasts. Suddenly
as I gazed I made out the glint of a light, and
then the whole bay and the beach were lit up in
a moment by a vivid blue glare. They were burning
a coloured signal-light on board of the vessel.
There she lay on her beam ends right in the
centre of the jagged reef, hurled over to such an
angle that I could see all the planking of her
deck. She was a large, two-masted schooner, of
foreign rig, and lay perhaps a hundred and eighty
or two hundred yards from the shore. Every
spar and rope and writhing piece of cordage
showed up hard and clear under the livid light
which sputtered and flickered from the highest
portion of the forecastle. Beyond the doomed
ship out of the great darkness came the long
rolling lines of black waves, never ending, never
tiring, with a petulant tuft of foam here and there
upon their crests. Each as it reached the broad
circle of unnatural light appeared to gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
strength and volume, and to hurry on more impetuously
until, with a roar and a jarring crash,
it sprang upon its victim. Clinging to the weather
shrouds I could distinctly see some ten or twelve
frightened seamen, who, when their light revealed
my presence, turned their white faces towards me
and waved their hands imploringly. I felt my
gorge rise against these poor cowering worms.
Why should they presume to shirk the narrow
pathway along which all that is great and noble
among mankind has travelled? There was one
there who interested me more than they. He
was a tall man who stood apart from the others,
balancing himself upon the swaying wreck as
though he disdained to cling to rope or bulwark.
His hands were clasped behind his back, and his
head was sunk upon his breast; but even in that
despondent attitude there was a litheness and
decision in his pose and in every motion which
marked him as a man little likely to yield to
despair. Indeed, I could see by his occasional
rapid glances up and down and all around him
that he was weighing every chance of safety; but
though he often gazed across the raging surf to
where he could see my dark figure upon the beach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
his self-respect, or some other reason, forbade him
from imploring my help in any way. He stood,
dark, silent, and inscrutable, looking down on the
black sea, and waiting for whatever fortune Fate
might send him.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that that problem would very
soon be settled. As I looked, an enormous billow,
topping all the others, and coming after them, like
a driver following a flock, swept over the vessel.
Her foremast snapped short off, and the men who
clung to the shrouds were brushed away like a
swarm of flies. With a rending, riving sound the
ship began to split in two, where the sharp back
of the Mansie reef was sawing into her keel. The
solitary man upon the forecastle ran rapidly across
the deck and seized hold of a white bundle which
I had already observed, but failed to make out.
As he lifted it up the light fell upon it, and I saw
that the object was a woman, with a spar lashed
across her body and under her arms in such a
way that her head should always rise above water.
He bore her tenderly to the side and seemed to
speak for a minute or so to her, as though explaining
the impossibility of remaining upon the ship.
Her answer was a singular one. I saw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
deliberately raise her hand and strike him across
the face with it. He appeared to be silenced for a
moment or so by this; but he addressed her again,
directing her, as far as I could gather from his
motions, how she should behave when in the
water. She shrank away from him, but he caught
her in his arms. He stooped over her for a
moment and seemed to press his lips against her
forehead. Then a great wave came welling up
against the side of the breaking vessel, and,
leaning over, he placed her upon the summit of
it as gently as a child might be committed to its
cradle. I saw her white dress flickering among
the foam on the crest of the dark billow, and
then the light sank gradually lower, and the
riven ship and its lonely occupant were hidden
from my eyes.</p>

<p>As I watched those things my manhood overcame
my philosophy, and I felt a frantic impulse
to be up and doing. I threw my cynicism to one
side as a garment which I might don again at
leisure, and I rushed wildly to my boat and my
sculls. She was a leaky tub, but what then?
Was I, who had cast many a wistful, doubtful
glance at my opium bottle, to begin now to weigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
chances and to cavil at danger? I dragged her
down to the sea with the strength of a maniac, and
sprang in. For a moment or two it was a question
whether she could live among the boiling surge,
but a dozen frantic strokes took me through it,
half-full of water but still afloat. I was out on the
unbroken waves now, at one time climbing, climbing
up the broad black breast of one, then sinking
down, down on the other side, until looking up I
could see the gleam of the foam all around me
against the dark heavens. Far behind me I could
hear the wild wailings of old Madge, who, seeing
me start, thought no doubt that my madness had
come to a climax. As I rowed I peered over my
shoulder, until at last on the belly of a great wave
which was sweeping towards me I distinguished
the vague white outline of the woman. Stooping
over I seized her as she swept by me, and with an
effort lifted her, all sodden with water, into the
boat. There was no need to row back, for the
next billow carried us in and threw us upon the
beach. I dragged the boat out of danger, and
then lifting up the woman I carried her to the
house, followed by my housekeeper, loud with
congratulation and praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that I had done this thing a reaction set
in upon me. I felt that my burden lived, for I
heard the faint beat of her heart as I pressed my
ear against her side in carrying her. Knowing
this, I threw her down beside the fire which Madge
had lit, with as little sympathy as though she had
been a bundle of faggots. I never glanced at her
to see if she were fair or no. For many years I
had cared little for the face of a woman. As I lay
in my hammock upstairs, however, I heard the old
woman, as she chafed the warmth back into her,
crooning a chorus of "Eh, the puir lassie! Eh,
the bonnie lassie!" from which I gathered that
this piece of jetsam was both young and comely.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The morning after the gale was peaceful and
sunny. As I walked along the long sweep of sand
I could hear the panting of the sea. It was
heaving and swirling about the reef, but along the
shore it rippled in gently enough. There was no
sign of the schooner, nor was there any wreckage
upon the beach, which did not surprise me, as I
knew there was a great undertow in those waters.
A couple of broad-winged gulls were hovering and
skimming over the scene of the shipwreck, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
though many strange things were visible to them
beneath the waves. At times I could hear their
raucous voices as they spoke to one another of
what they saw.</p>

<p>When I came back from my walk the woman
was waiting at the door for me. I began to wish
when I saw her that I had never saved her, for
here was an end of my privacy. She was very
young&mdash;at the most nineteen, with a pale, somewhat
refined face, yellow hair, merry blue eyes,
and shining teeth. Her beauty was of an ethereal
type. She looked so white and light and fragile
that she might have been the spirit of that storm-foam
from out of which I plucked her. She had
wreathed some of Madge's garments round her in
a way which was quaint and not unbecoming. As
I strode heavily up the pathway she put out her
hands with a pretty childlike gesture, and ran
down towards me, meaning, as I surmise, to thank
me for having saved her, but I put her aside with
a wave of my hand and passed her. At this she
seemed somewhat hurt, and the tears sprang into
her eyes; but she followed me into the sitting-room
and watched me wistfully. "What country do
you come from?" I asked her suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>She smiled when I spoke, but shook her head.</p>

<p>"Francais?" I asked. "Deutsch?" "Espagnol?"&mdash;each
time she shook her head, and then
she rippled off into a long statement in some
tongue of which I could not understand one
word.</p>

<p>After breakfast was over, however, I got a clue
to her nationality. Passing along the beach once
more, I saw that in a cleft of the ridge a piece of
wood had been jammed. I rowed out to it in my
boat and brought it ashore. It was part of the
sternpost of a boat, and on it, or rather on the
piece of wood attached to it, was the word "Archangel,"
painted in strange, quaint lettering. "So,"
I thought, as I paddled slowly back, "this pale
damsel is a Russian. A fit subject for the White
Czar, and a proper dweller on the shores of the
White Sea!" It seemed to me strange that one
of her apparent refinement should perform so long
a journey in so frail a craft. When I came back
into the house I pronounced the word "Archangel"
several times in different intonations, but
she did not appear to recognise it.</p>

<p>I shut myself up in the laboratory all the
morning, continuing a research which I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
making upon the nature of the allotropic forms
of carbon and of sulphur. When I came out at
mid-day for some food, she was sitting by the table
with a needle and thread mending some rents in
her clothes, which were now dry. I resented her
continued presence, but I could not turn her out
on the beach to shift for herself. Presently she
presented a new phase of her character. Pointing
to herself and then to the scene of the shipwreck,
she held up one finger, by which I understood her
to be asking whether she was the only one saved.
I nodded my head to indicate that she was. On
this she sprang out of the chair, with a cry of
great joy, and holding the garment which she
was mending over her head, and swaying it from
side to side with the motion of her body, she
danced as lightly as a feather all round the room,
and then out through the open door into the
sunshine. As she whirled round she sang in a
plaintive, shrill voice some uncouth, barbarous
chant, expressive of exultation. I called out to
her, "Come in, you young fiend; come in, and
be silent!" but she went on with her dance. Then
she suddenly ran towards me, and catching my
hand before I could pluck it away, she kissed it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
While we were at dinner she spied one of my
pencils, and taking it up she wrote the two words
"Sophie Ramusine" upon a piece of paper, and
then pointed to herself as a sign that that was
her name. She handed the pencil to me, evidently
expecting that I would be equally communicative,
but I put it in my pocket as a sign that I wished
to hold no intercourse with her.</p>

<p>Every moment of my life now I regretted the
unguarded precipitancy with which I had saved
this woman. What was it to me whether she had
lived or died? I was no young hot-headed youth
to do such things. It was bad enough to be
compelled to have Madge in the house, but she
was old and ugly, and could be ignored. This
one was young and lively, and so fashioned as to
divert attention from graver things. Where could
I send her, and what could I do with her? If I
sent information to Wick it would mean that
officials and others would come to me, and pry,
and peep, and chatter&mdash;a hateful thought. It was
better to endure her presence than that.</p>

<p>I soon found that there were fresh troubles in
store for me. There is no place safe from the
swarming, restless race of which I am a member.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
In the evening, when the sun was dipping down
behind the hills, casting them into dark shadow,
but gilding the sands and casting a great glory
over the sea, I went, as is my custom, for a stroll
along the beach. Sometimes on these occasions
I took my book with me. I did so on this night,
and stretching myself upon a sand-dune I composed
myself to read. As I lay there I suddenly
became aware of a shadow which interposed itself
between the sun and myself. Looking round, I
saw, to my great surprise, a very tall, powerful
man, who was standing a few yards off, and who,
instead of looking at me, was ignoring my existence
completely, and was gazing over my head
with a stern set face at the bay and the black line
of the Mansie reef. His complexion was dark,
with black hair and short curling beard, a hawk-like
nose, and golden earrings in his ears&mdash;the
general effect being wild and somewhat noble. He
wore a faded velveteen jacket, a red flannel shirt,
and high sea-boots, coming half-way up his thighs.
I recognised him at a glance as being the same man
who had been left on the wreck the night before.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" I said, in an aggrieved voice. "You
got ashore all right, then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, in good English. "It was
no doing of mine. The waves threw me up. I
wish to God I had been allowed to drown!" There
was a slight foreign lisp in his accent which was
rather pleasing. "Two good fishermen, who live
round yonder point, pulled me out and cared for
me&mdash;yet I could not honestly thank them for it."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" thought I, "here is a man of my
own kidney. Why do you wish to be drowned?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Because," he cried, throwing out his long arms
with a passionate, despairing gesture, "there&mdash;there
in that blue smiling bay lies my soul, my
treasure&mdash;everything that I loved and lived for."</p>

<p>"Well, well," I said. "People are ruined every
day, but there's no use making a fuss about it.
Let me inform you that this ground on which you
walk is my ground, and that the sooner you take
yourself off it the better pleased I shall be. One
of you is quite trouble enough."</p>

<p>"One of us?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you could take her off with you I should
be still more grateful."</p>

<p>He gazed at me for a moment as if hardly able
to realise what I said, and then, with a wild cry, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
ran away from me with prodigious speed and raced
along the sands towards my house. Never before
or since have I seen a human being run so fast.
I followed as rapidly as I could, furious at this
threatened invasion, but long before I reached the
house he had disappeared through the open door.
I heard a great scream from the inside, and, as I
came nearer, the sound of the man's bass voice
speaking rapidly and loudly. When I looked in,
the girl Sophie Ramusine was crouching in a
corner, cowering away, with fear and loathing
expressed on her averted face and in every line of
her shrinking form. The other, with his dark eyes
flashing, and his outstretched hands quivering
with emotion, was pouring forth a torrent of
passionate, pleading words. He made a step
forward to her as I entered, but she writhed
still further away, and uttered a sharp cry like
that of a rabbit when the weazel has him by the
throat.</p>

<p>"Here!" I said, pulling him back from her.
"This is a pretty to-do! What do you mean?
Do you think this is a wayside inn or place of
public accommodation?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," he said, "excuse me. This woman is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
my wife, and I feared that she was drowned. You
have brought me back to life."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I asked roughly.</p>

<p>"I am a man from Archangel," he said simply:
"a Russian man."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Ourganeff."</p>

<p>"Ourganeff!&mdash;and hers is Sophie Ramusine.
She is no wife of yours. She has no ring."</p>

<p>"We are man and wife in the sight of Heaven,"
he said solemnly, looking upwards. "We are
bound by higher laws than those of earth." As
he spoke the girl slipped behind me and caught
me by the other hand, pressing it as though
beseeching my protection. "Give me up my
wife, sir," he went on. "Let me take her away
from here."</p>

<p>"Look here, you&mdash;whatever your name is," I
said sternly, "I don't want this wench here. I
wish I had never seen her. If she died it would
be no grief to me. But as to handing her over to
you, when it is clear she fears and hates you, I
won't do it. So now just clear your great body
out of this, and leave me to my books. I hope I
may never look upon your face again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"You won't give her up to me?" he said
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I'll see you damned first!" I answered.</p>

<p>"Suppose I take her," he cried, his dark face
growing darker.</p>

<p>All my tigerish blood flushed up in a moment.
I picked up a billet of wood from beside the fireplace.
"Go," I said, in a low voice; "go quick, or
I may do you an injury." He looked at me irresolutely
for a moment, and then he left the house.
He came back again in a moment, however, and
stood in the doorway looking in at us.</p>

<p>"Have a heed what you do," he said. "The
woman is mine, and I shall have her. When it
comes to blows, a Russian is as good a man as a
Scotchman."</p>

<p>"We shall see that," I cried, springing forward,
but he was already gone, and I could see his tall
form moving away through the gathering darkness.</p>

<p>For a month or more after this things went
smoothly with us. I never spoke to the Russian
girl, nor did she ever address me. Sometimes
when I was at work at my laboratory she would
slip inside the door and sit silently there watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
me with her great eyes. At first this intrusion
annoyed me, but by degrees, finding that she made
no attempt to distract my attention, I suffered her
to remain. Encouraged by this concession, she
gradually came to move the stool on which she sat
nearer and nearer to my table, until, after gaining
a little every day during some weeks, she at last
worked her way right up to me, and used to perch
herself beside me whenever I worked. In this
position she used, still without ever obtruding her
presence in any way, to make herself very useful
by holding my pens, test-tubes, bottles, etc., and
handing me whatever I wanted, with never-failing
sagacity. By ignoring the fact of her being a
human being, and looking upon her as a useful
automatic machine, I accustomed myself to her
presence so far as to miss her on the few occasions
when she was not at her post. I have a habit of
talking aloud to myself at times when I work, so
as to fix my results better in my mind. The girl
must have had a surprising memory for sounds, for
she could always repeat the words which I let fall
in this way, without, of course, understanding in
the least what they meant. I have often been
amused at hearing her discharge a volley of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
chemical equations and algebraic symbols at old
Madge, and then burst into a ringing laugh when
the crone would shake her head, under the impression,
no doubt, that she was being addressed in
Russian.</p>

<p>She never went more than a few yards from the
house, and indeed never put her foot over the
threshold without looking carefully out of each
window, in order to be sure that there was nobody
about. By this I knew that she suspected that her
fellow-countryman was still in the neighbourhood,
and feared that he might attempt to carry her off.
She did something else which was significant. I
had an old revolver with some cartridges, which
had been thrown away among the rubbish. She
found this one day, and at once proceeded to clean
it and oil it. She hung it up near the door, with
the cartridges in a little bag beside it, and whenever
I went for a walk she would take it down
and insist upon my carrying it with me. In my
absence she would always bolt the door. Apart
from her apprehensions she seemed fairly happy,
busying herself in helping Madge when she was
not attending upon me. She was wonderfully
nimble-fingered and natty in all domestic duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long before I discovered that her
suspicions were well founded, and that this man
from Archangel was still lurking in the vicinity.
Being restless one night, I rose and peered out of
the window. The weather was somewhat cloudy,
and I could barely make out the line of the sea
and the loom of my boat upon the beach. As I
gazed, however, and my eyes became accustomed
to the obscurity, I became aware that there was
some other dark blur upon the sands, and that in
front of my very door, where certainly there had
been nothing of the sort the preceding night. As
I stood at my diamond-paned lattice still peering
and peeping to make out what this might be, a
great bank of clouds rolled slowly away from the
face of the moon, and a flood of cold, clear light
was poured down upon the silent bay and the long
sweep of its desolate shores. Then I saw what
this was which haunted my doorstep. It was he,
the Russian. He squatted there like a gigantic
toad, with his legs doubled under him in strange
Mongolian fashion, and his eyes fixed apparently
upon the window of the room in which the young
girl and the housekeeper slept. The light fell
upon his upturned face, and I saw once more the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
hawk-like grace of his countenance, with the single
deeply-indented line of care upon his brow, and
the protruding beard which marks the passionate
nature. My first impulse was to shoot him as a
trespasser, but as I gazed my resentment changed
into pity and contempt. "Poor fool," I said to
myself, "is it then possible that you, whom I have
seen looking open-eyed at present death, should
have your whole thoughts and ambition centred
upon this wretched slip of a girl&mdash;a girl, too, who
flies from you and hates you! Most women
would love you&mdash;were it but for that dark face
and great handsome body of yours&mdash;and yet you
must needs hanker after the one in a thousand
who will have no traffic with you." As I returned
to my bed I chuckled much to myself over this
thought. I knew that my bars were strong and
my bolts thick. It mattered little to me whether
this strange man spent his night at my door or a
hundred leagues off, so long as he was gone by the
morning. As I expected, when I rose and went
out there was no sign of him, nor had he left any
trace of his midnight vigil.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before I saw him
again. I had been out for a row one morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
for my head was aching, partly from prolonged
stooping and partly from the effects of a noxious
drug which I had inhaled the night before. I
pulled along the coast some miles, and then,
feeling thirsty, I landed at a place where I knew
that a fresh water stream trickled down into the
sea. This rivulet passed through my land, but
the mouth of it, where I found myself that day,
was beyond my boundary line. I felt somewhat
taken aback when, rising from the stream at which
I had slaked my thirst, I found myself face to
face with the Russian. I was as much a trespasser
now as he was, and I could see at a glance that
he knew it.</p>

<p>"I wish to speak a few words to you," he said
gravely.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, then!" I answered, glancing at
my watch. "I have no time to listen to chatter."</p>

<p>"Chatter!" he repeated angrily. "Ah, but there!
You Scotch people are strange men. Your face
is hard and your words rough, but so are those
of the good fishermen with whom I stay, yet I
find that beneath it all there lies kind, honest
natures. No doubt you are kind and good too,
in spite of your roughness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the name of the devil," I said, "say your
say, and go your way. I am weary of the sight
of you."</p>

<p>"Can I not soften you in any way?" he cried.
"Ah, see&mdash;see here"&mdash;he produced a small Grecian
cross from inside his velvet jacket. "Look at this.
Our religions may differ in form, but at least we
have some common thoughts and feelings when
we see this emblem."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," I answered.</p>

<p>He looked at me thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You are a very strange man," he said at last.
"I cannot understand you. You still stand between
me and Sophie. It is a dangerous position
to take, sir. Oh, believe me, before it is too late.
If you did but know what I have done to gain
that woman&mdash;how I have risked my body, how
I have lost my soul. You are a small obstacle
to some which I have surmounted&mdash;you, whom
a rip with a knife, or a blow from a stone,
would put out of my way for ever. But God
preserve me from that," he cried wildly. "I am
deep&mdash;too deep&mdash;already. Anything rather than
that."</p>

<p>"You would do better to go back to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
country," I said, "than to skulk about these sand-hills
and disturb my leisure. When I have proof
that you have gone away, I shall hand this woman
over to the protection of the Russian Consul
at Edinburgh. Until then, I shall guard her
myself, and not you, nor any Muscovite that ever
breathed, shall take her from me."</p>

<p>"And what is your object in keeping me from
Sophie?" he asked. "Do you imagine that I
would injure her? Why, man, I would give my
life freely to save her from the slightest harm.
Why do you do this thing?"</p>

<p>"I do it because it is my good pleasure to act
so," I answered. "I give no man reasons for my
conduct."</p>

<p>"Look here!" he cried, suddenly blazing into
fury, and advancing towards me with his shaggy
mane bristling and his brown hands clenched.
"If I thought you had one dishonest thought
towards this girl&mdash;if for a moment I had reason to
believe that you had any base motive for detaining
her&mdash;as sure as there is a God in Heaven I should
drag the heart out of your bosom with my hands."
The very idea seemed to have put the man in a
frenzy, for his face was all distorted and his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
opened and shut convulsively. I thought that he
was about to spring at my throat.</p>

<p>"Stand off!" I said, putting my hand on my
pistol. "If you lay a finger on me I shall kill you."</p>

<p>He put his hand into his pocket, and for a
moment I thought that he was about to produce
a weapon too, but instead of that he whipped out
a cigarette and lit it, breathing the smoke rapidly
into his lungs. No doubt he had found by experience
that this was the most effectual way of
curbing his passions.</p>

<p>"I told you," he said in a quieter voice, "that
my name is Ourganeff&mdash;Alexis Ourganeff. I am
a Finn by birth, but I have spent my life in every
part of the world. I was one who could never be
still, nor settle down to a quiet existence. After I
came to own my own ship there is hardly a port
from Archangel to Australia which I have not
entered. I was rough and wild and free, but
there was one at home, sir, who was prim and
white-handed and soft-tongued, skilful in little
fancies and conceits which women love. This
youth by his wiles and tricks stole from me the
love of the girl whom I had ever marked as my
own, and who up to that time had seemed in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
sort inclined to return my passion. I had been on
a voyage to Hammerfest for ivory, and coming
back unexpectedly, I learned that my pride and
treasure was to be married to this soft-skinned
boy, and that the party had actually gone to the
church. In such moments, sir, something gives
way in my head, and I hardly know what I do.
I landed with a boat's crew&mdash;all men who had
sailed with me for years, and who were as true
as steel. We went up to the church. They
were standing, she and he, before the priest,
but the thing had not been done. I dashed
between them and caught her round the waist.
My men beat back the frightened bridegroom and
the lookers-on. We bore her down to the boat
and aboard our vessel, and then getting up anchor,
we sailed away across the White Sea until the
spires of Archangel sank down behind the horizon.
She had my cabin, my room, every comfort. I
slept among the men in the forecastle. I hoped
that in time her aversion to me would wear away,
and that she would consent to marry me in
England or in France. For days and days we
sailed. We saw the North Cape die away behind
us, and we skirted the grey Norwegian coast, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
still, in spite of every attention, she would not
forgive me for tearing her from that pale-faced
lover of hers. Then came this cursed storm which
shattered both my ship and my hopes, and has
deprived me even of the sight of the woman for
whom I have risked so much. Perhaps she may
learn to love me yet. You, sir," he said wistfully,
"look like one who has seen much of the
world. Do you not think that she may come to
forget this man and to love me?" "I am tired of
your story," I said, turning away. "For my part,
I think you are a great fool. If you imagine that
this love of yours will pass away, you had best
amuse yourself as best you can until it does. If,
on the other hand, it is a fixed thing, you cannot do
better than cut your throat, for that is the shortest
way out of it. I have no more time to waste on
the matter." With this I hurried away and walked
down to the boat. I never looked round, but I
heard the dull sound of his feet upon the sands as
he followed me.</p>

<p>"I have told you the beginning of my story," he
said, "and you shall know the end some day.
You would do well to let the girl go."</p>

<p>I never answered him, but pushed the boat off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
When I had rowed some distance out I looked
back and saw his tall figure upon the yellow sand
as he stood gazing thoughtfully after me. When
I looked again, some minutes later, he had disappeared.</p>

<p>For a long time after this my life was as regular
and as monotonous as it had been before the
shipwreck. At times I hoped that the man from
Archangel had gone away altogether, but certain
footsteps which I saw upon the sand, and more
particularly a little pile of cigarette ash which I
found one day behind a hillock from which a view
of the house might be obtained, warned me that,
though invisible, he was still in the vicinity. My
relations with the Russian girl remained the same
as before. Old Madge had been somewhat jealous
of her presence at first, and seemed to fear that
what little authority she had would be taken away
from her. By degrees, however, as she came to
realise my utter indifference, she became reconciled
to the situation, and, as I have said before, profited
by it, as our visitor performed much of the domestic
work.</p>

<p>And now I am coming near the end of this
narrative of mine, which I have written a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
deal more for my own amusement than for that
of any one else. The termination of the strange
episode in which these two Russians had played a
part was as wild and as sudden as the commencement.
The events of one single night freed me
from all my troubles, and left me once more alone
with my books and my studies, as I had been
before their intrusion. Let me endeavour to
describe how this came about.</p>

<p>I had had a long day of heavy and wearying
work, so that in the evening I determined upon
taking a long walk. When I emerged from the
house my attention was attracted by the appearance
of the sea. It lay like a sheet of glass, so
that never a ripple disturbed its surface. Yet the
air was filled with that indescribable moaning
sound which I have alluded to before&mdash;a sound as
though the spirits of all those who lay beneath
those treacherous waters were sending a sad
warning of coming troubles to their brethren in
the flesh. The fishermen's wives along that coast
know the eerie sound, and look anxiously across
the waters for the brown sails making for the
land. When I heard it I stepped back into the
house and looked at the glass. It was down below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
29°. Then I knew that a wild night was coming
upon us.</p>

<p>Underneath the hills where I walked that evening
it was dull and chill, but their summits were
rosy-red and the sea was brightened by the
sinking sun. There were no clouds of importance
in the sky, yet the dull groaning of the sea grew
louder and stronger. I saw, far to the eastward,
a brig beating up for Wick, with a reef in her
topsails. It was evident that her captain had read
the signs of nature as I had done. Behind her a
long, lurid haze lay low upon the water, concealing
the horizon. "I had better push on," I thought to
myself, "or the wind may rise before I get back."</p>

<p>I suppose I must have been at least half a mile
from the house when I suddenly stopped and
listened breathlessly. My ears were so accustomed
to the noises of nature, the sighing of the breeze
and the sob of the waves, that any other sound
made itself heard at a great distance. I waited,
listening with all my ears. Yes, there it was again&mdash;a
long-drawn, shrill cry of despair, ringing over
the sands and echoed back from the hills behind
me&mdash;a piteous appeal for aid. It came from the
direction of my house. I turned and ran back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
homewards at the top of my speed, ploughing
through the sand, racing over the shingle. In my
mind there was a great dim perception of what
had occurred.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile from the house there
is a high sandhill, from which the whole country
round is visible. When I reached the top of this
I paused for a moment. There was the old grey
building&mdash;there the boat. Everything seemed to
be as I had left it. Even as I gazed, however, the
shrill scream was repeated, louder than before, and
the next moment a tall figure emerged from my
door&mdash;the figure of the Russian sailor. Over his
shoulder was the white form of the young girl, and
even in his haste he seemed to bear her tenderly
and with gentle reverence. I could hear her wild
cries and see her desperate struggles to break
away from him. Behind the couple came my old
housekeeper, staunch and true, as the aged dog,
who can no longer bite, still snarls with toothless
gums at the intruder. She staggered feebly along
at the heels of the ravisher, waving her long, thin
arms, and hurling, no doubt, volleys of Scotch
curses and imprecations at his head. I saw at
a glance that he was making for the boat. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
sudden hope sprang up in my soul that I might
be in time to intercept him. I ran for the beach
at the top of my speed. As I ran I slipped a
cartridge into my revolver. This I determined
should be the last of these invasions.</p>

<p>I was too late. By the time I reached the
water's edge he was a hundred yards away, making
the boat spring with every stroke of his powerful
arms. I uttered a wild cry of impotent anger, and
stamped up and down the sands like a maniac.
He turned and saw me. Rising from his seat he
made me a graceful bow, and waved his hand to
me. It was not a triumphant or a derisive gesture.
Even my furious and distempered mind recognised
it as being a solemn and courteous leave-taking.
Then he settled down to his oars once more, and
the little skiff shot away out over the bay. The
sun had gone down now, leaving a single dull, red
streak upon the water, which stretched away until
it blended with the purple haze on the horizon.
Gradually the skiff grew smaller and smaller
as it sped across this lurid band, until the
shades of night gathered round it and it became
a mere blur upon the lonely sea. Then this
vague loom died away also, and darkness settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
over it&mdash;a darkness which should never more be
raised.</p>

<p>And why did I pace the solitary shore, hot and
wrathful as a wolf whose whelp has been torn from
it? Was it that I loved this Muscovite girl? No&mdash;a
thousand times no. I am not one who, for the
sake of a white skin or a blue eye, would belie my
own life, and change the whole tenor of my thoughts
and existence. My heart was untouched. But my
pride&mdash;ah, there I had been cruelly wounded. To
think that I had been unable to afford protection
to the helpless one who craved it of me, and who
relied on me! It was that which made my heart
sick and sent the blood buzzing through my ears.</p>

<p>That night a great wind rose up from the sea,
and the wild waves shrieked upon the shore as
though they would tear it back with them into the
ocean. The turmoil and the uproar were congenial
to my vexed spirit. All night I wandered up and
down, wet with spray and rain, watching the gleam
of the white breakers, and listening to the outcry of
the storm. My heart was bitter against the Russian.
I joined my feeble pipe to the screaming of the gale.
"If he would but come back again!" I cried, with
clenched hands; "if he would but come back!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>He came back. When the grey light of morning
spread over the eastern sky and lit up the
great waste of yellow, tossing waters, with the
brown clouds drifting swiftly over them, then I
saw him once again. A few hundred yards off
along the sand there lay a long dark object, cast
up by the fury of the waves. It was my boat,
much shattered and splintered. A little farther
on, a vague, shapeless something was washing to
and fro in the shallow water, all mixed with
shingle and with sea-weed. I saw at a glance that
it was the Russian, face downwards and dead. I
rushed into the water and dragged him up on to the
beach. It was only when I turned him over that
I discovered that she was beneath him, his dead
arms encircling her, his mangled body still intervening
between her and the fury of the storm. It
seemed that the fierce German Sea might beat the
life from him, but with all its strength it was
unable to tear this one-idea'd man from the
woman whom he loved. There were signs which
led me to believe that during that awful night the
woman's fickle mind had come at last to learn the
worth of the true heart and strong arm which
struggled for her and guarded her so tenderly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Why else should her little head be nestling so
lovingly on his broad breast, while her yellow hair
entwined itself with his flowing beard? Why, too,
should there be that bright smile of ineffable
happiness and triumph, which death itself had not
had power to banish from his dusky face? I
fancy that death had been brighter to him than
life had ever been.</p>

<p>Madge and I buried them there on the shores of
the desolate northern sea. They lie in one grave
deep down beneath the yellow sand. Strange
things may happen in the world around them.
Empires may rise and may fall, dynasties may
perish, great wars may come and go, but, heedless
of it all, those two shall embrace each other for
ever and aye in their lonely shrine by the side of
the sounding ocean. I sometimes have thought
that their spirits flit like shadowy sea-mews over
the wild waters of the bay. No cross or symbol
marks their resting-place, but old Madge puts wild
flowers upon it at times; and when I pass on my
daily walk, and see the fresh blossoms scattered
over the sand, I think of the strange couple who
came from afar and broke for a little space the
dull tenor of my sombre life.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class ="smcap">"All</span> aboard?" said the captain.</p>

<p>"All aboard, sir!" said the mate.</p>

<p>"Then stand by to let her go."</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock on a Wednesday morning.
The good ship <i>Spartan</i> was lying off Boston Quay
with her cargo under hatches, her passengers
shipped, and everything prepared for a start. The
warning whistle had been sounded twice, the final
bell had been rung. Her bowsprit was turned
towards England, and the hiss of escaping steam
showed that all was ready for her run of three
thousand miles. She strained at the warps that
held her like a greyhound at its leash.</p>

<p>I have the misfortune to be a very nervous man.
A sedentary literary life has helped to increase the
morbid love of solitude which, even in my boyhood,
was one of my distinguishing characteristics.
As I stood upon the quarter-deck of the Transatlantic
steamer, I bitterly cursed the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
which drove me back to the land of my forefathers.
The shouts of the sailors, the rattle of the cordage,
the farewells of my fellow-passengers, and the
cheers of the mob, each and all jarred upon my
sensitive nature. I felt sad too. An indescribable
feeling, as of some impending calamity, seemed to
haunt me. The sea was calm, and the breeze
light. There was nothing to disturb the equanimity
of the most confirmed of landsmen, yet I
felt as if I stood upon the verge of a great though
indefinable danger. I have noticed that such
presentiments occur often in men of my peculiar
temperament, and that they are not uncommonly
fulfilled. There is a theory that it arises from a
species of second-sight&mdash;a subtle spiritual communication
with the future. I well remember that
Herr Raumer, the eminent spiritualist, remarked
on one occasion that I was the most sensitive
subject as regards supernatural phenomena that he
had ever encountered in the whole of his wide
experience. Be that as it may, I certainly felt
far from happy as I threaded my way among the
weeping, cheering groups which dotted the white
decks of the good ship <i>Spartan</i>. Had I known
the experience which awaited me in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the next twelve hours, I would even then at the
last moment have sprung upon the shore, and
made my escape from the accursed vessel.</p>

<p>"Time's up!" said the captain, closing his
chronometer with a snap, and replacing it in his
pocket. "Time's up!" said the mate. There was
a last wail from the whistle, a rush of friends and
relatives upon the land. One warp was loosened,
the gangway was being pushed away, when there
was a shout from the bridge, and two men appeared
running rapidly down the quay. They were waving
their hands and making frantic gestures, apparently
with the intention of stopping the ship. "Look
sharp!" shouted the crowd. "Hold hard!" cried
the captain. "Ease her! stop her! Up with the
gangway!" and the two men sprang aboard just as
the second warp parted, and a convulsive throb of
the engine shot us clear of the shore. There was a
cheer from the deck, another from the quay, a
mighty fluttering of handkerchiefs, and the great
vessel ploughed its way out of the harbour,
and steamed grandly away across the placid
bay.</p>

<p>We were fairly started upon our fortnight's
voyage. There was a general dive among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
passengers in quest of berths and luggage, while a
popping of corks in the saloon proved that more
than one bereaved traveller was adopting artificial
means for drowning the pangs of separation. I
glanced round the deck and took a running inventory
of my <i>compagnons de voyage</i>. They
presented the usual types met with upon these
occasions. There was no striking face among
them. I speak as a connoisseur, for faces are a
specialty of mine. I pounce upon a characteristic
feature as a botanist does on a flower, and bear it
away with me to analyse at my leisure, and classify
and label it in my little anthropological museum.
There was nothing worthy of me here. Twenty
types of young America going to "Yurrup," a few
respectable middle-aged couples as an antidote,
a sprinkling of clergymen and professional men,
young ladies, bagmen, British exclusives, and all
the <i>olla podrida</i> of an ocean-going steamer. I
turned away from them and gazed back at the
receding shores of America, and, as a cloud of
remembrances rose before me, my heart warmed
towards the land of my adoption. A pile of
portmanteaus and luggage chanced to be lying on
one side of the deck, awaiting their turn to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
taken below. With my usual love for solitude I
walked behind these, and sitting on a coil of rope
between them and the vessel's side, I indulged in a
melancholy reverie.</p>

<p>I was aroused from this by a whisper behind
me. "Here's a quiet place," said the voice. "Sit
down, and we can talk it over in safety."</p>

<p>Glancing through a chink between two colossal
chests, I saw that the passengers who had joined
us at the last moment were standing at the other
side of the pile. They had evidently failed to see
me as I crouched in the shadow of the boxes.
The one who had spoken was a tall and very thin
man with a blue-black beard and a colourless face.
His manner was nervous and excited. His companion
was a short, plethoric little fellow, with a
brisk and resolute air. He had a cigar in his
mouth, and a large ulster slung over his left arm.
They both glanced round uneasily, as if to ascertain
whether they were alone. "This is just the place,"
I heard the other say. They sat down on a bale
of goods with their backs turned towards me, and
I found myself, much against my will, playing the
unpleasant part of eavesdropper to their conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Muller," said the taller of the two, "we've
got it aboard right enough."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the man whom he had addressed
as Muller; "it's safe aboard."</p>

<p>"It was rather a near go."</p>

<p>"It was that, Flannigan."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have done to have missed the ship."</p>

<p>"No; it would have put our plans out."</p>

<p>"Ruined them entirely," said the little man, and
puffed furiously at his cigar for some minutes.</p>

<p>"I've got it here," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Let me see it."</p>

<p>"Is no one looking?"</p>

<p>"No; they are nearly all below."</p>

<p>"We can't be too careful where so much is at
stake," said Muller, as he uncoiled the ulster which
hung over his arm, and disclosed a dark object
which he laid upon the deck. One glance at it
was enough to cause me to spring to my feet with
an exclamation of horror. Luckily they were so
engrossed in the matter on hand that neither of
them observed me. Had they turned their heads
they would infallibly have seen my pale face
glaring at them over the pile of boxes.</p>

<p>From the first moment of their conversation a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
horrible misgiving had come over me. It seemed
more than confirmed as I gazed at what lay before
me. It was a little square box made of some dark
wood, and ribbed with brass. I suppose it was
about the size of a cubic foot. It reminded me of
a pistol-case, only it was decidedly higher. There
was an appendage to it, however, on which my
eyes were riveted, and which suggested the pistol
itself rather than its receptacle. This was a trigger-like
arrangement upon the lid, to which a coil of
string was attached. Beside this trigger there was
a small square aperture through the wood. The
tall man, Flannigan, as his companion called him,
applied his eye to this and peered in for several
minutes with an expression of intense anxiety upon
his face.</p>

<p>"It seems right enough," he said at last.</p>

<p>"I tried not to shake it," said his companion.</p>

<p>"Such delicate things need delicate treatment.
Put in some of the needful, Muller."</p>

<p>The shorter man fumbled in his pocket for some
time, and then produced a small paper packet.
He opened this, and took out of it half a handful
of whitish granules, which he poured down through
the hole. A curious clicking noise followed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the inside of the box, and both the men smiled in
a satisfied way.</p>

<p>"Nothing much wrong there," said Flannigan.</p>

<p>"Right as a trivet," answered his companion.</p>

<p>"Look out! here's some one coming. Take it
down to our berth. It wouldn't do to have any
one suspecting what our game is, or, worse still,
have them fumbling with it, and letting it off by
mistake."</p>

<p>"Well, it would come to the same, whoever let
it off," said Muller.</p>

<p>"They'd be rather astonished if they pulled the
trigger," said the taller, with a sinister laugh.
"Ha, ha! fancy their faces! It's not a bad bit
of workmanship, I flatter myself."</p>

<p>"No," said Muller. "I hear it is your own
design, every bit of it, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the spring and the sliding shutter are my
own."</p>

<p>"We should take out a patent."</p>

<p>And the two men laughed again with a cold,
harsh laugh, as they took up the little brass-bound
package and concealed it in Muller's voluminous
overcoat.</p>

<p>"Come down, and we'll stow it in our berth,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
said Flannigan. "We won't need it until to-night,
and it will be safe there."</p>

<p>His companion assented, and the two went arm-in-arm
along the deck and disappeared down the
hatchway, bearing the mysterious little box away
with them. The last words I heard were a
muttered injunction from Flannigan to carry it
carefully, and avoid knocking it against the bulwarks.</p>

<p>How long I remained sitting on that coil of rope
I shall never know. The horror of the conversation
I had just overheard was aggravated by the
first sinking qualms of sea-sickness. The long roll
of the Atlantic was beginning to assert itself over
both ship and passengers. I felt prostrated in
mind and in body, and fell into a state of collapse,
from which I was finally aroused by the hearty
voice of our worthy quartermaster.</p>

<p>"Do you mind moving out of that, sir?" he
said. "We want to get this lumber cleared off
the deck."</p>

<p>His bluff manner and ruddy, healthy face seemed
to be a positive insult to me in my present condition.
Had I been a courageous or a muscular
man I could have struck him. As it was, I treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the honest sailor to a melodramatic scowl, which
seemed to cause him no small astonishment, and
strode past him to the other side of the deck.
Solitude was what I wanted&mdash;solitude in which I
could brood over the frightful crime which was
being hatched before my very eyes. One of the
quarter-boats was hanging rather low down upon
the davits. An idea struck me, and, climbing on
the bulwarks, I stepped into the empty boat and
lay down in the bottom of it. Stretched on my
back, with nothing but the blue sky above me, and
an occasional view of the mizzen as the vessel
rolled, I was at least alone with my sickness and
my thoughts.</p>

<p>I tried to recall the words which had been
spoken in the terrible dialogue I had overheard.
Would they admit of any construction but the one
which stared me in the face? My reason forced
me to confess that they would not. I endeavoured
to array the various facts which formed the chain
of circumstantial evidence, and to find a flaw in it;
but no, not a link was missing. There was the
strange way in which our passengers had come
aboard, enabling them to evade any examination
of their luggage. The very name of "Flannigan"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
smacked of Fenianism, while "Muller" suggested
nothing but Socialism and murder. Then their
mysterious manner; their remark that their plans
would have been ruined had they missed the ship;
their fear of being observed; last, but not least,
the clenching evidence in the production of the
little square box with the trigger, and their grim
joke about the face of the man who should let it
off by mistake&mdash;could these facts lead to any conclusion
other than that they were the desperate
emissaries of some body, political or otherwise,
and intended to sacrifice themselves, their fellow-passengers,
and the ship, in one great holocaust?
The whitish granules which I had seen one of
them pour into the box formed no doubt a fuse
or train for exploding it. I had myself heard a
sound come from it which might have emanated
from some delicate piece of machinery. But what
did they mean by their allusion to to-night? Could
it be that they contemplated putting their horrible
design into execution on the very first evening of
our voyage? The mere thought of it sent a cold
shudder over me, and made me for a moment
superior even to the agonies of sea-sickness.</p>

<p>I have remarked that I am a physical coward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
I am a moral one also. It is seldom that the two
defects are united to such a degree in the one
character. I have known many men who were
most sensitive to bodily danger, and yet were
distinguished for the independence and strength
of their minds. In my own case, however, I
regret to say that my quiet and retiring habits
had fostered a nervous dread of doing anything
remarkable, or making myself conspicuous, which
exceeded, if possible, my fear of personal
peril. An ordinary mortal placed under the circumstances
in which I now found myself would
have gone at once to the captain, confessed
his fears, and put the matter into his hands. To
me, however, constituted as I am, the idea was
most repugnant. The thought of becoming the
observed of all observers, cross-questioned by a
stranger, and confronted with two desperate conspirators
in the character of a denouncer, was
hateful to me. Might it not by some remote
possibility prove that I was mistaken? What
would be my feelings if there should turn out to
be no grounds for my accusation? No, I would
procrastinate; I would keep my eye on the two
desperadoes and dog them at every turn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Anything was better than the possibility of being
wrong.</p>

<p>Then it struck me that even at that moment
some new phase of the conspiracy might be
developing itself. The nervous excitement seemed
to have driven away my incipient attack of sickness,
for I was able to stand up and lower myself
from the boat without experiencing any return of
it. I staggered along the deck with the intention
of descending into the cabin and finding how my
acquaintances of the morning were occupying
themselves. Just as I had my hand on the companion-rail,
I was astonished by receiving a hearty
slap on the back, which nearly shot me down the
steps with more haste than dignity.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Hammond?" said a voice which I
seemed to recognise.</p>

<p>"God bless me," I said as I turned round, "it
can't be Dick Merton! Why, how are you, old
man?"</p>

<p>This was an unexpected piece of luck in the
midst of my perplexities. Dick was just the man
I wanted; kindly and shrewd in his nature, and
prompt in his actions, I should have no difficulty
in telling him my suspicions, and could rely upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
his sound sense to point out the best course to
pursue. Since I was a little lad in the second
form at Harrow, Dick had been my adviser and
protector. He saw at a glance that something
had gone wrong with me.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said, in his kindly way, "what's
put you about, Hammond? You look as white as
a sheet. <i>Mal de mer</i>, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, not that altogether," said I. "Walk up
and down with me, Dick; I want to speak to you.
Give me your arm."</p>

<p>Supporting myself on Dick's stalwart frame,
I tottered along by his side; but it was some
time before I could muster resolution to speak.</p>

<p>"Have a cigar," said he, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said I. "Dick, we shall all be
corpses to-night."</p>

<p>"That's no reason against your having a cigar
now," said Dick, in his cool way, but looking hard
at me from under his shaggy eyebrows as he
spoke. He evidently thought that my intellect
was a little gone.</p>

<p>"No," I continued; "it's no laughing matter, and
I speak in sober earnest, I assure you. I have
discovered an infamous conspiracy, Dick, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
destroy this ship and every soul that is in her;"
and I then proceeded systematically, and in order,
to lay before him the chain of evidence which I
had collected. "There, Dick," I said, as I concluded,
"what do you think of that? and, above
all, what am I to do?"</p>

<p>To my astonishment he burst into a hearty fit
of laughter.</p>

<p>"I'd be frightened," he said, "if any fellow but
you had told me as much. You always had a
way, Hammond, of discovering mares' nests. I
like to see the old traits breaking out again. Do
you remember at school how you swore there was
a ghost in the long room, and how it turned out
to be your own reflection in the mirror? Why,
man," he continued, "what object would any one
have in destroying this ship? We have no great
political guns aboard. On the contrary, the
majority of the passengers are Americans. Besides,
in this sober nineteenth century, the most wholesale
murderers stop at including themselves among
their victims. Depend upon it, you have misunderstood
them, and have mistaken a photographic
camera, or something equally innocent, for an
infernal machine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort, sir," said I, rather touchily.
"You will learn to your cost, I fear, that I have
neither exaggerated nor misinterpreted a word.
As to the box, I have certainly never before seen
one like it. It contained delicate machinery; of
that I am convinced, from the way in which the
men handled it and spoke of it."</p>

<p>"You'd make out every packet of perishable
goods to be a torpedo," said Dick, "if that is to
be your only test."</p>

<p>"The man's name was Flannigan," I continued.</p>

<p>"I don't think that would go very far in a court
of law," said Dick; "but come, I have finished
my cigar. Suppose we go down together and split
a bottle of claret. You can point out these two
Orsinis to me if they are still in the cabin."</p>

<p>"All right," I answered; "I am determined not
to lose sight of them all day. Don't look hard at
them, though; for I don't want them to think that
they are being watched."</p>

<p>"Trust me," said Dick; "I'll look as unconscious
and guileless as a lamb;" and with that we passed
down the companion and into the saloon.</p>

<p>A good many passengers were scattered about the
great central table, some wrestling with refractory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
carpet-bags and rug-straps, some having their
luncheon, and a few reading and otherwise amusing
themselves. The objects of our quest were not
there. We passed down the room and peered
into every berth; but there was no sign of them.
"Heavens!" thought I, "perhaps at this very
moment they are beneath our feet, in the hold
or engine-room, preparing their diabolical contrivance!"
It was better to know the worst than
to remain in such suspense.</p>

<p>"Steward," said Dick, "are there any other
gentlemen about?"</p>

<p>"There's two in the smoking-room, sir," answered
the steward.</p>

<p>The smoking-room was a little snuggery, luxuriously
fitted up, and adjoining the pantry. We
pushed the door open and entered. A sigh of
relief escaped from my bosom. The very first
object on which my eye rested was the cadaverous
face of Flannigan, with its hard-set mouth and
unwinking eye. His companion sat opposite to
him. They were both drinking, and a pile of cards
lay upon the table. They were engaged in playing
as we entered. I nudged Dick to show him that
we had found our quarry, and we sat down beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
them with as unconcerned an air as possible. The
two conspirators seemed to take little notice of
our presence. I watched them both narrowly.
The game at which they were playing was
"Napoleon." Both were adepts at it; and I could
not help admiring the consummate nerve of men
who, with such a secret at their hearts, could
devote their minds to the manipulating of a long
suit or the finessing of a queen. Money changed
hands rapidly; but the run of luck seemed to be
all against the taller of the two players. At last
he threw down his cards on the table with an oath
and refused to go on.</p>

<p>"No, I'm hanged if I do!" he said; "I haven't
had more than two of a suit for five hands."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said his comrade, as he gathered
up his winnings; "a few dollars one way or the
other won't go very far after to-night's work."</p>

<p>I was astonished at the rascal's audacity, but
took care to keep my eyes fixed abstractedly upon
the ceiling, and drank my wine in as unconscious
a manner as possible. I felt that Flannigan was
looking towards me with his wolfish eyes to see
if I had noticed the allusion. He whispered something
to his companion which I failed to catch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
It was a caution, I suppose, for the other answered
rather angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Why shouldn't I say what I like?
Over-caution is just what would ruin us."</p>

<p>"I believe you want it not to come off," said
Flannigan.</p>

<p>"You believe nothing of the sort," said the other,
speaking rapidly and loudly. "You know as
well as I do that when I play for a stake I like
to win it. But I won't have my words criticised and
cut short by you or any other man; I have as much
interest in our success as you have&mdash;more, I hope."</p>

<p>He was quite hot about it, and puffed furiously
at his cigar for a few minutes. The eyes of the
other ruffian wandered alternately from Dick
Merton to myself. I knew that I was in the
presence of a desperate man, that a quiver of my
lip might be the signal for him to plunge a weapon
into my heart; but I betrayed more self-command
than I should have given myself credit for under
such trying circumstances. As to Dick, he was
as immovable and apparently as unconscious as
the Egyptian Sphinx.</p>

<p>There was silence for some time in the smoking-room,
broken only by the crisp rattle of the cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
as the man Muller shuffled them up before replacing
them in his pocket. He still seemed to
be somewhat flushed and irritable. Throwing the
end of his cigar into the spittoon, he glanced
defiantly at his companion, and turned towards me.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, sir," he said, "when this ship
will be heard of again?"</p>

<p>They were both looking at me; but though my
face may have turned a trifle paler, my voice was
as steady as ever as I answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I presume, sir, that it will be heard of first
when it enters Queenstown Harbour."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the angry little man; "I
knew you would say that. Don't you kick me
under the table, Flannigan; I won't stand it. I
know what I am doing. You are wrong, sir," he
continued, turning to me; "utterly wrong."</p>

<p>"Some passing ship, perhaps," suggested Dick.</p>

<p>"No, nor that either."</p>

<p>"The weather is fine," I said; "why should we
not be heard of at our destination?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say we shouldn't be heard of at our
destination. No doubt we shall in the course of
time; but that is not where we shall be heard of
first."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where then?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"That you will never know. Suffice it that a
rapid and mysterious agency will signal our whereabouts,
and that before the day is out. Ha, ha!"
and he chuckled once again.</p>

<p>"Come on deck!" growled his comrade; "you
have drunk too much of that confounded brandy-and-water.
It has loosened your tongue. Come
away!" and taking him by the arm he half led
him, half forced him out of the smoking-room,
and we heard them stumbling up the companion
together, and on to the deck.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think now?" I gasped, as I
turned towards Dick. He was as imperturbable
as ever.</p>

<p>"Think!" he said; "why, I think what his companion
thinks&mdash;that we have been listening to the
ravings of a half-drunken man. The fellow stunk
of brandy."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Dick! you saw how the other tried
to stop his tongue."</p>

<p>"Of course he did. He didn't want his friend
to make a fool of himself before strangers. Maybe
the short one is a lunatic, and the other his private
keeper. It's quite possible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Dick, Dick," I cried; "how can you be so
blind? Don't you see that every word confirmed
our previous suspicion?"</p>

<p>"Humbug, man!" said Dick; "you're working
yourself into a state of nervous excitement. Why,
what the devil do <i>you</i> make of all that nonsense
about a mysterious agent which would signal our
whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what he meant, Dick," I said,
bending forward and grasping my friend's arm.
"He meant a sudden glare and a flash seen far out
at sea by some lonely fisherman off the American
coast. That's what he meant."</p>

<p>"I didn't think you were such a fool, Hammond,"
said Dick Merton testily. "If you try to fix a
literal meaning on the twaddle that every drunken
man talks, you will come to some queer conclusions.
Let us follow their example, and go on
deck. You need fresh air, I think. Depend upon
it, your liver is out of order. A sea-voyage will
do you a world of good."</p>

<p>"If ever I see the end of this one," I groaned,
"I'll promise never to venture on another. They
are laying the cloth, so it's hardly worth while my
going up. I'll stay below and finish my smoke."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope dinner will find you in a more pleasant
state of mind," said Dick; and he went out, leaving
me to my thoughts until the clang of the great
gong summoned us to the saloon.</p>

<p>My appetite, I need hardly say, had not been
improved by the incidents which had occurred
during the day. I sat down, however, mechanically
at the table, and listened to the talk which was
going on around me. There were nearly a hundred
first-class passengers, and as the wine began to
circulate, their voices combined with the clash of
the dishes to form a perfect Babel. I found myself
seated between a very stout and nervous old lady
and a prim little clergyman; and as neither made
any advances, I retired into my shell, and spent
my time in observing the appearance of my fellow-voyagers.
I could see Dick in the dim distance
dividing his attentions between a jointless fowl in
front of him and a self-possessed young lady at
his side. Captain Dowie was doing the honours at
my end, while the surgeon of the vessel was seated
at the other. I was glad to notice that Flannigan
was placed almost opposite to me. As long as I
had him before my eyes I knew that, for the time
at least, we were safe. He was sitting with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
was meant to be a sociable smile on his grim face.
It did not escape me that he drank largely of wine&mdash;so
largely that even before the dessert appeared
his voice had become decidedly husky. His friend
Muller was seated a few places lower down. He
ate little, and appeared to be nervous and restless.</p>

<p>"Now, ladies," said our genial captain, "I trust
that you will consider yourselves at home aboard
my vessel. I have no fears for the gentlemen. A
bottle of champagne, steward. Here's to a fresh
breeze and a quick passage! I trust our friends
in America will hear of our safe arrival in twelve
days, or a fortnight at the very latest."</p>

<p>I looked up. Quick as was the glance which
passed between Flannigan and his confederate, I
was able to intercept it. There was an evil smile
upon the former's thin lips.</p>

<p>The conversation rippled on. Politics, the sea,
amusements, religion, each was in turn discussed.
I remained a silent though an interested listener.
It struck me that no harm could be done by
introducing the subject which was ever in my
mind. It could be managed in an off-hand way,
and would at least have the effect of turning the
captain's thoughts in that direction. I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
watch, too, what effect it would have upon the
faces of the conspirators.</p>

<p>There was a sudden lull in the conversation.
The ordinary subjects of interest appeared to be
exhausted. The opportunity was a favourable
one.</p>

<p>"May I ask, captain," I said, bending forward,
and speaking very distinctly, "what you think of
Fenian manifestoes?"</p>

<p>The captain's ruddy face became a shade darker
from honest indignation.</p>

<p>"They are poor cowardly things," he said, "as
silly as they are wicked."</p>

<p>"The impotent threats of a set of anonymous
scoundrels," said a pompous-looking old gentleman
beside him.</p>

<p>"Oh, captain!" said the fat lady at my side,
"you don't really think they would blow up a
ship?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt they would if they could.
But I am very sure they will never blow up
mine."</p>

<p>"May I ask what precautions are taken against
them?" said an elderly man at the end of the
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"All goods sent aboard the ship are strictly
examined," said Captain Dowie.</p>

<p>"But suppose a man brought explosives aboard
with him?" said I.</p>

<p>"They are too cowardly to risk their own lives
in that way."</p>

<p>During this conversation Flannigan had not
betrayed the slightest interest in what was going
on. He raised his head now, and looked at the
captain.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you are rather underrating
them?" he said. "Every secret society has produced
desperate men&mdash;why shouldn't the Fenians
have them too? Many men think it a privilege
to die in the service of a cause which seems right
in their eyes, though others may think it wrong."</p>

<p>"Indiscriminate murder cannot be right in anybody's
eyes," said the little clergyman.</p>

<p>"The bombardment of Paris was nothing else,"
said Flannigan; "yet the whole civilised world
agreed to look on with folded arms, and change
the ugly word 'murder' into the more euphonious
one of 'war.' It seemed right enough to German
eyes; why shouldn't dynamite seem so to the
Fenian?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"At any rate their empty vapourings have led to
nothing as yet," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," returned Flannigan, "but is there
not some room for doubt yet as to the fate
of the <i>Dotterel</i>? I have met men in America
who asserted from their own personal knowledge
that there was a coal torpedo aboard that
vessel."</p>

<p>"Then they lied," said the captain. "It was
proved conclusively at the court-martial to have
arisen from an explosion of coal-gas&mdash;but we had
better change the subject, or we may cause the
ladies to have a restless night;" and the conversation
once more drifted back into its original
channel.</p>

<p>During this little discussion Flannigan had
argued his point with a gentlemanly deference
and a quiet power for which I had not given him
credit. I could not help admiring a man who, on
the eve of a desperate enterprise, could courteously
argue upon a point which must touch him so
nearly. He had, as I have already mentioned,
partaken of a considerable quantity of wine; but
though there was a slight flush upon his pale
cheek, his manner was as reserved as ever. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
did not join in the conversation again, but seemed
to be lost in thought.</p>

<p>A whirl of conflicting ideas was battling in my
own mind. What was I to do? Should I stand
up now and denounce them before both passengers
and captain? Should I demand a few minutes'
conversation with the latter in his own cabin, and
reveal it all? For an instant I was half resolved
to do it, but then the old constitutional timidity
came back with redoubled force. After all there
might be some mistake. Dick had heard the evidence,
and had refused to believe in it. I determined
to let things go on their course. A strange
reckless feeling came over me. Why should I
help men who were blind to their own danger?
Surely it was the duty of the officers to protect us,
not ours to give warning to them. I drank off a
couple of glasses of wine, and staggered upon deck
with the determination of keeping my secret locked
in my own bosom.</p>

<p>It was a glorious evening. Even in my excited
state of mind I could not help leaning against the
bulwarks and enjoying the refreshing breeze.
Away to the westward a solitary sail stood out
as a dark speck against the great sheet of flame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
left by the setting sun. I shuddered as I looked
at it. It seemed like a sea of blood. A single star
was twinkling faintly above our main-mast, but a
thousand seemed to gleam in the water below with
every stroke of our propeller. The only blot in
the fair scene was the great trail of smoke which
stretched away behind us like a black slash upon a
crimson curtain. It seemed hard to believe that
the great peace which hung over all Nature could
be marred by a poor miserable mortal.</p>

<p>"After all," I thought, as I gazed upon the blue
depths beneath me, "if the worst comes to the
worst, it is better to die here than to linger in
agony upon a sick-bed on land." A man's life
seems a very paltry thing amid the great forces of
Nature. All my philosophy could not prevent my
shuddering, however, when I turned my head and
saw two shadowy figures at the other side of the
deck, which I had no difficulty in recognising.
They seemed to be conversing earnestly, but I
had no opportunity of overhearing what was
said; so I contented myself with pacing up and
down, and keeping a vigilant watch upon their
movements.</p>

<p>It was a relief to me when Dick came on deck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Even an incredulous confidant is better than none
at all.</p>

<p>"Well, old man," he said, giving me a facetious
dig in the ribs, "we've not been blown up yet."</p>

<p>"No, not yet," said I; "but that's no proof that
we are not going to be."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man!" said Dick; "I can't conceive
what has put this extraordinary idea into your
head. I have been talking to one of your supposed
assassins, and he seems a pleasant fellow
enough; quite a sporting character, I should think,
from the way he speaks."</p>

<p>"Dick," I said, "I am as certain that those men
have an infernal machine, and that we are on the
verge of eternity, as if I saw them putting the
match to the fuse."</p>

<p>"Well, if you really think so," said Dick, half
awed for the moment by the earnestness of my
manner, "it is your duty to let the captain know of
your suspicions."</p>

<p>"You are right," I said; "I will. My absurd
timidity has prevented my doing so sooner. I
believe our lives can only be saved by laying the
whole matter before him."</p>

<p>"Well, go and do it now," said Dick; "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
for goodness' sake don't mix me up in the
matter."</p>

<p>"I'll speak to him when he comes off the bridge,"
I answered; "and in the meantime I don't mean
to lose sight of them."</p>

<p>"Let me know of the result," said my companion;
and with a nod he strolled away in
search, I fancy, of his partner at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>Left to myself, I bethought me of my retreat
of the morning, and climbing on the bulwark I
mounted into the quarter-boat, and lay down there.
In it I could reconsider my course of action, and by
raising my head I was able at any time to get a
view of my disagreeable neighbours.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and the captain was still on the
bridge. He was talking to one of the passengers,
a retired naval officer, and the two were deep in
debate concerning some abstruse point in navigation.
I could see the red tips of their cigars from
where I lay. It was dark now&mdash;so dark that I
could hardly make out the figures of Flannigan
and his accomplice. They were still standing in
the position which they had taken up after dinner.
A few of the passengers were scattered about
the deck, but many had gone below. A strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
stillness seemed to pervade the air. The voices of
the watch and the rattle of the wheel were the
only sounds which broke the silence.</p>

<p>Another half-hour passed. The captain was still
upon the bridge. It seemed as if he would never
come down. My nerves were in a state of
unnatural tension, so much so that the sound of
two steps upon the deck made me start up in a
quiver of excitement. I peered over the side of
the boat, and saw that our suspicious passengers
had crossed from the other side and were standing
almost directly beneath me. The light of a binnacle
fell full upon the ghastly face of the ruffian
Flannigan. Even in that short glance I saw that
Muller had the ulster, whose use I knew so well,
slung loosely over his arm. I sank back with a
groan. It seemed that my fatal procrastination
had sacrificed two hundred innocent lives.</p>

<p>I had read of the fiendish vengeance which
awaited a spy. I knew that men with their lives
in their hands would stick at nothing. All I could
do was to cower at the bottom of the boat and
listen silently to their whispered talk below.</p>

<p>"This place will do," said a voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, the leeward side is best."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder if the trigger will act?"</p>

<p>"I am sure it will."</p>

<p>"We were to let it off at ten, were we not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at ten sharp. We have eight minutes yet."
There was a pause. Then the voice began again&mdash;</p>

<p>"They'll hear the drop of the trigger, won't
they?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. It will be too late for any
one to prevent its going off."</p>

<p>"That's true. There will be some excitement
among those we have left behind, won't there?"</p>

<p>"Rather! How long do you reckon it will be
before they hear of us?"</p>

<p>"The first news will get in in about twenty-four
hours."</p>

<p>"That will be mine."</p>

<p>"No, mine."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! we'll settle that."</p>

<p>There was a pause here. Then I heard Muller's
voice in a ghastly whisper, "There's only five
minutes more."</p>

<p>How slowly the moments seemed to pass! I
could count them by the throbbing of my heart.</p>

<p>"It'll make a sensation on land," said a voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, it will make a noise in the newspapers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>I raised my head and peered over the side of
the boat. There seemed no hope, no help. Death
stared me in the face, whether I did or did not
give the alarm. The captain had at last left the
bridge. The deck was deserted, save for those two
dark figures crouching in the shadow of the boat.</p>

<p>Flannigan had a watch lying open in his hand.</p>

<p>"Three minutes more," he said. "Put it down
upon the deck."</p>

<p>"No, put it here on the bulwarks."</p>

<p>It was the little square box. I knew by the
sound that they had placed it near the davit, and
almost exactly under my head.</p>

<p>I looked over again. Flannigan was pouring
something out of a paper into his hand. It was
white and granular&mdash;the same that I had seen him
use in the morning. It was meant as a fuse, no
doubt, for he shovelled it into the little box, and
I heard the strange noise which had previously
arrested my attention.</p>

<p>"A minute and a half more," he said. "Shall
you or I pull the string?"</p>

<p>"I will pull it," said Muller.</p>

<p>He was kneeling down and holding the end in
his hand. Flannigan stood behind with his arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
folded, and an air of grim resolution upon his
face.</p>

<p>I could stand it no longer. My nervous system
seemed to give way in a moment.</p>

<p>"Stop!" I screamed, springing to my feet.
"Stop, misguided and unprincipled men!"</p>

<p>They both staggered backwards. I fancy they
thought I was a spirit, with the moonlight streaming
down upon my pale face.</p>

<p>I was brave enough now. I had gone too far to
retreat.</p>

<p>"Cain was damned," I cried, "and he slew but
one; would you have the blood of two hundred
upon your souls?"</p>

<p>"He's mad!" said Flannigan. "Time's up!
Let it off, Muller."</p>

<p>I sprang down upon the deck.</p>

<p>"You shan't do it!" I said.</p>

<p>"By what right do you prevent us?"</p>

<p>"By every right, human and divine."</p>

<p>"It's no business of yours. Clear out of this!"</p>

<p>"Never!" said I.</p>

<p>"Confound the fellow! There's too much at
stake to stand on ceremony. I'll hold him, Muller,
while you pull the trigger."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>Next moment I was struggling in the herculean
grasp of the Irishman. Resistance was useless; I
was a child in his hands.</p>

<p>He pinned me up against the side of the vessel,
and held me there.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "look sharp. He can't prevent
us."</p>

<p>I felt that I was standing on the verge of
eternity. Half-strangled in the arms of the taller
ruffian, I saw the other approach the fatal box.
He stooped over it and seized the string. I
breathed one prayer when I saw his grasp tighten
upon it. Then came a sharp snap, a strange rasping
noise. The trigger had fallen, the side of the box
flew out, and let off&mdash;<i>two grey carrier-pigeons</i>!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Little more need be said. It is not a subject on
which I care to dwell. The whole thing is too
utterly disgusting and absurd. Perhaps the best
thing I can do is to retire gracefully from the
scene, and let the sporting correspondent of the
<i>New York Herald</i> fill my unworthy place. Here
is an extract clipped from its columns shortly
after our departure from America:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pigeon-flying Extraordinary.&mdash;A novel match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
has been brought off, last week, between the birds
of John H. Flannigan, of Boston, and Jeremiah
Muller, a well-known citizen of Ashport. Both
men have devoted much time and attention to an
improved breed of bird, and the challenge is an old-standing
one. The pigeons were backed to a large
amount, and there was considerable local interest
in the result. The start was from the deck of the
Transatlantic steamship <i>Spartan</i>, at ten o'clock on
the evening of the day of starting, the vessel being
then reckoned to be about a hundred miles from
the land. The bird which reached home first was
to be declared the winner. Considerable caution
had, we believe, to be observed, as British captains
have a prejudice against the bringing off of sporting
events aboard their vessels. In spite of some little
difficulty at the last moment, the trap was sprung
almost exactly at ten o'clock. Muller's bird arrived
in Ashport in an extreme state of exhaustion on
the following afternoon, while Flannigan's has not
been heard of. The backers of the latter have the
satisfaction of knowing, however, that the whole
affair has been characterised by extreme fairness.
The pigeons were confined in a specially invented
trap, which could only be opened by the spring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
It was thus possible to feed them through an
aperture in the top, but any tampering with their
wings was quite out of the question. A few such
matches would go far towards popularising pigeon-flying
in America, and form an agreeable variety
to the morbid exhibitions of human endurance
which have assumed such proportions during the
last few years."</p>

<h2><a name="A_NIGHT_AMONG_THE_NIHILISTS" id="A_NIGHT_AMONG_THE_NIHILISTS"><i>A NIGHT AMONG THE NIHILISTS.</i></a></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class ="smcap">"Robinson</span>, the boss wants you!"</p>

<p>"The dickens he does!" thought I; for Mr.
Dickson, Odessa agent of Bailey &amp; Co., corn
merchants, was a bit of a Tartar, as I had learned
to my cost. "What's the row now?" I demanded
of my fellow-clerk; "has he got scent of our
Nicolaieff escapade, or what is it?"</p>

<p>"No idea," said Gregory: "the old boy seems
in a good enough humour; some business matter,
probably. But don't keep him waiting." So summoning
up an air of injured innocence, to be
ready for all contingencies, I marched into the
lion's den.</p>

<p>Mr. Dickson was standing before the fire in
a Briton's time-honoured attitude, and motioned
me into a chair in front of him. "Mr. Robinson,"
he said, "I have great confidence in your discretion
and common sense. The follies of youth
will break out, but I think that you have a sterling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
foundation to your character underlying any
superficial levity."</p>

<p>I bowed.</p>

<p>"I believe," he continued, "that you can speak
Russian pretty fluently."</p>

<p>I bowed again.</p>

<p>"I have, then," he proceeded, "a mission which
I wish you to undertake, and on the success of
which your promotion may depend. I would
not trust it to a subordinate, were it not that duty
ties me to my post at present."</p>

<p>"You may depend upon my doing my best,
sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Right, sir; quite right! What I wish you to
do is briefly this: The line of railway has just
been opened to Solteff, some hundred miles up
the country. Now, I wish to get the start of
the other Odessa firms in securing the produce of
that district, which I have reason to believe may
be had at very low prices. You will proceed by
rail to Solteff, and interview a Mr. Dimidoff, who
is the largest landed proprietor in the town.
Make as favourable terms as you can with him.
Both Mr. Dimidoff and I wish the whole thing
to be done as quietly and secretly as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>&mdash;in
fact, that nothing should be known about the
matter until the grain appears in Odessa. I desire
it for the interests of the firm, and Mr. Dimidoff
on account of the prejudice his peasantry entertain
against exportation. You will find yourself expected
at the end of your journey, and will start
to-night. Money shall be ready for your expenses.
Good-morning, Mr. Robinson; I hope you won't
fail to realise the good opinion I have of your
abilities."</p>

<p>"Gregory," I said, as I strutted into the office,
"I'm off on a mission&mdash;a secret mission, my boy;
an affair of thousands of pounds. Lend me your
little portmanteau&mdash;mine's too imposing&mdash;and tell
Ivan to pack it. A Russian millionaire expects
me at the end of my journey. Don't breathe a
word of it to any of Simpkins's people, or the
whole game will be up. Keep it dark!"</p>

<p>I was so charmed at being, as it were, behind
the scenes, that I crept about the office all day
in a sort of cloak-and-bloody-dagger style, with
responsibility and brooding care marked upon
every feature; and when at night I stepped out
and stole down to the station, the unprejudiced
observer would certainly have guessed, from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
general behaviour, that I had emptied the contents
of the strong-box before starting into that
little valise of Gregory's. It was imprudent of
him, by the way, to leave English labels pasted
all over it. However, I could only hope that
the "Londons" and "Birminghams" would attract
no attention, or at least that no rival corn-merchant
might deduce from them who I was
and what my errand might be.</p>

<p>Having paid the necessary roubles and got my
ticket, I ensconced myself in the corner of a
snug Russian car, and pondered over my extraordinary
good fortune. Dickson was growing old
now, and if I could make my mark in this matter
it might be a great thing for me. Dreams arose
of a partnership in the firm. The noisy wheels
seemed to clank out "Bailey, Robinson &amp; Co.,"
"Bailey, Robinson &amp; Co.," in a monotonous
refrain, which gradually sank into a hum, and
finally ceased as I dropped into a deep sleep.
Had I known the experience which awaited me
at the end of my journey it would hardly have
been so peaceable.</p>

<p>I awoke with an uneasy feeling that some one
was watching me closely; nor was I mistaken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
A tall dark man had taken up his position on
the seat opposite, and his black sinister eyes
seemed to look through me and beyond me, as
if he wished to read my very soul. Then I saw
him glance down at my little trunk.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" thought I, "here's Simpkins's
agent, I suppose. It was careless of Gregory
to leave those confounded labels on the valise."</p>

<p>I closed my eyes for a time, but on reopening
them I again caught the stranger's earnest
gaze.</p>

<p>"From England, I see," he said in Russian,
showing a row of white teeth in what was meant
to be an amiable smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, trying to look unconcerned,
but painfully aware of my failure.</p>

<p>"Travelling for pleasure, perhaps?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered eagerly. "Certainly for
pleasure; nothing else."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said he, with a shade of irony
in his voice. "Englishmen always travel for
pleasure, don't they? Oh, no; nothing else."</p>

<p>His conduct was mysterious, to say the least
of it. It was only explainable upon two hypotheses&mdash;he
was either a madman, or he was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
agent of some firm bound upon the same errand
as myself, and determined to show me that he
guessed my little game. They were about equally
unpleasant, and, on the whole, I was relieved
when the train pulled up in the tumble-down
shed which does duty for a station in the rising
town of Solteff&mdash;Solteff, whose resources I was
about to open out, and whose commerce I was
to direct into the great world channels. I almost
expected to see a triumphal arch as I stepped
on to the platform.</p>

<p>I was to be expected at the end of my journey,
so Mr. Dickson had informed me. I looked about
among the motley crowd, but saw no Mr. Dimidoff.
Suddenly a slovenly, unshaved man passed me
rapidly, and glanced first at me and then at my
trunk&mdash;that wretched trunk, the cause of all my
woes. He disappeared in the crowd; but in a
little time came strolling past me again, and
contrived to whisper as he did so, "Follow me,
but at some distance," immediately setting off
out of the station and down the street at a rapid
pace. Here was mystery with a vengeance!
I trotted along in his rear with my valise, and
on turning the corner found a rough droschky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
waiting for me. My unshaven friend opened the
door, and I stepped in.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Dim&mdash;&mdash;" I was beginning.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he cried. "No names, no names; the
very walls have ears. You will hear all to-night;"
and with that assurance he closed the door, and,
seizing the reins, we drove off at a rapid pace&mdash;so
rapid that I saw my black-eyed acquaintance of
the railway carriage gazing after us in surprise
until we were out of sight.</p>

<p>I thought over the whole matter as we jogged
along in that abominable springless conveyance.</p>

<p>"They say the nobles are tyrants in Russia," I
mused; "but it seems to me to be the other way
about, for here's this poor Mr. Dimidoff, who
evidently thinks his ex-serfs will rise and murder
him if he raises the price of grain in the district
by exporting some out of it. Fancy being obliged
to have recourse to all this mystery and deception
in order to sell one's own property! Why, it's worse
than an Irish landlord. It is monstrous! Well, he
doesn't seem to live in a very aristocratic quarter
either," I soliloquised, as I gazed out at the narrow
crooked streets and the unkempt dirty Muscovites
whom we passed. "I wish Gregory or some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
was with me, for it's a cut-throat-looking shop!
By Jove, he's pulling up; we must be there!"</p>

<p>We <i>were</i> there, to all appearance; for the
droschky stopped, and my driver's shaggy head
appeared through the aperture.</p>

<p>"It is here, most honoured master," he said, as
he helped me to alight.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Dimi&mdash;&mdash;" I commenced; but he interrupted
me again.</p>

<p>"Anything but names," he whispered; "anything
but that. You are too used to a land that is free.
Caution, oh sacred one!" and he ushered me down
a stone-flagged passage, and up a stair at the end
of it. "Sit for a few minutes in this room," he
said, opening a door, "and a repast will be served
for you;" and with that he left me to my own
reflections.</p>

<p>"Well," thought I, "whatever Mr. Dimidoff's
house may be like, his servants are undoubtedly
well trained. 'Oh sacred one!' and 'revered
master!' I wonder what he'd call old Dickson
himself, if he is so polite to the clerk! I suppose
it wouldn't be the thing to smoke in this little
crib; but I could do a pipe nicely. By the way,
how confoundedly like a cell it looks!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>It certainly did look like a cell. The door was
an iron one, and enormously strong, while the
single window was closely barred. The floor was
of wood, and sounded hollow and insecure as I
strode across it. Both floor and walls were thickly
splashed with coffee or some other dark liquid.
On the whole, it was far from being a place where
one would be likely to become unreasonably
festive.</p>

<p>I had hardly concluded my survey when I heard
steps approaching down the corridor, and the door
was opened by my old friend of the droschky. He
announced that my dinner was ready, and, with
many bows and apologies for leaving me in what
he called the "dismissal room," he led me down
the passage, and into a large and beautifully
furnished apartment. A table was spread for two
in the centre of it, and by the fire was standing a
man very little older than myself. He turned as I
came in, and stepped forward to meet me with
every symptom of profound respect.</p>

<p>"So young and yet so honoured!" he exclaimed;
and then seeming to recollect himself, he continued,
"Pray sit at the head of the table. You
must be fatigued by your long and arduous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
journey. We dine <i>tête-à-tête</i>; but the others
assemble afterwards."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dimidoff, I presume?" said I.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said he, turning his keen grey eyes
upon me. "My name is Petrokine; you mistake
me perhaps for one of the others. But now, not
a word of business until the council meets. Try
your <i>chef's</i> soup; you will find it excellent, I
think."</p>

<p>Who Mr. Petrokine or the others might be I
could not conceive. Land stewards of Dimidoff's,
perhaps; though the name did not seem familiar
to my companion. However, as he appeared to
shun any business questions at present, I gave in
to his humour, and we conversed on social life in
England&mdash;a subject in which he displayed considerable
knowledge and acuteness. His remarks,
too, on Malthus and the laws of population were
wonderfully good, though savouring somewhat of
Radicalism.</p>

<p>"By the way," he remarked, as we smoked a
cigar over our wine, "we should never have
known you but for the English labels on your
luggage; it was the luckiest thing in the world
that Alexander noticed them. We had had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
personal description of you; indeed we were
prepared to expect a somewhat older man. You
are young indeed, sir, to be entrusted with such
a mission."</p>

<p>"My employer trusts me," I replied; "and we
have learned in our trade that youth and shrewdness
are not incompatible."</p>

<p>"Your remark is true, sir," returned my newly-made
friend; "but I am surprised to hear you call
our glorious association a trade! Such a term is
gross indeed to apply to a body of men banded
together to supply the world with that which it is
yearning for, but which, without our exertions, it
can never hope to attain. A spiritual brotherhood
would be a more fitting term."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" thought I, "how pleased the boss
would be to hear him! He must have been in the
business himself, whoever he is."</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said Mr. Petrokine, "the clock points
to eight, and the council must be already sitting.
Let us go up together, and I will introduce you.
I need hardly say that the greatest secrecy is
observed, and that your appearance is anxiously
awaited."</p>

<p>I turned over in my mind as I followed him how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
I might best fulfil my mission and secure the most
advantageous terms. They seemed as anxious as
I was in the matter, and there appeared to be no
opposition, so perhaps the best thing would be to
wait and see what they would propose.</p>

<p>I had hardly come to this conclusion when my
guide swung open a large door at the end of a
passage, and I found myself in a room larger and
even more gorgeously fitted up than the one in
which I had dined. A long table, covered with
green baize and strewn with papers, ran down the
middle, and round it were sitting fourteen or
fifteen men conversing earnestly. The whole
scene reminded me forcibly of a gambling hell I
had visited some time before.</p>

<p>Upon our entrance the company rose and
bowed. I could not but remark that my companion
attracted no attention, while every eye was
turned upon me with a strange mixture of surprise
and almost servile respect. A man at the head of
the table, who was remarkable for the extreme
pallor of his face as contrasted with his blue-black
hair and moustache, waved his hand to a seat
beside him, and I sat down.</p>

<p>"I need hardly say," said Mr. Petrokine, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Gustave Berger, the English agent, is now honouring
us with his presence. He is young, indeed,
Alexis," he continued to my pale-faced neighbour,
"and yet he is of European reputation."</p>

<p>"Come, draw it mild!" thought I, adding aloud,
"If you refer to me, sir, though I am indeed acting
as English agent, my name is not Berger, but
Robinson&mdash;Mr. Tom Robinson, at your service."</p>

<p>A laugh ran round the table.</p>

<p>"So be it, so be it," said the man they called
Alexis. "I commend your discretion, most honoured
sir. One cannot be too careful. Preserve
your English <i>sobriquet</i> by all means. I regret that
any painful duty should be performed upon this
auspicious evening; but the rules of our association
must be preserved at any cost to our feelings,
and a dismissal is inevitable to-night."</p>

<p>"What the deuce is the fellow driving at?"
thought I. "What is it to me if he does give his
servant the sack? This Dimidoff, wherever he is,
seems to keep a private lunatic asylum."</p>

<p>"<i>Take out the gag!</i>" The words fairly shot
through me, and I started in my chair. It was
Petrokine who spoke. For the first time I noticed
that a burly stout man, sitting at the other end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the table, had his arms tied behind his chair and
a handkerchief round his mouth. A horrible
suspicion began to creep into my heart. Where
was I? Was I in Mr. Dimidoff's? Who were
these men, with their strange words?</p>

<p>"Take out the gag!" repeated Petrokine; and
the handkerchief was removed.</p>

<p>"Now, Paul Ivanovitch," said he, "what have
you to say before you go?"</p>

<p>"Not a dismissal, sirs," he pleaded; "not a dismissal:
anything but that! I will go into some
distant land, and my mouth shall be closed for
ever. I will do anything that the society asks;
but pray, pray do not dismiss me."</p>

<p>"You know our laws, and you know your
crime," said Alexis, in a cold, harsh voice. "Who
drove us from Odessa by his false tongue and his
double face? Who wrote the anonymous letter to
the Governor? Who cut the wire that would have
destroyed the arch-tyrant? You did, Paul Ivanovitch;
and you must die."</p>

<p>I leaned back in my chair and fairly gasped.</p>

<p>"Remove him!" said Petrokine; and the man
of the droschky, with two others, forced him out.</p>

<p>I heard the footsteps pass down the passage, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
then a door open and shut. Then came a sound
as of a struggle, ended by a heavy, crunching blow
and a dull thud.</p>

<p>"So perish all who are false to their oath," said
Alexis solemnly; and a hoarse "Amen" went up
from his companions.</p>

<p>"Death alone can dismiss us from our order,"
said another man further down; "but Mr. Berg&mdash;Mr.
Robinson is pale. The scene has been
too much for him after his long journey from
England."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, Tom," thought I, "if ever you get out
of this scrape you'll turn over a new leaf. You're
not fit to die, and that's a fact." It was only too
evident to me now that by some strange misconception
I had got in among a gang of cold-blooded
Nihilists, who mistook me for one of their order.
I felt, after what I had witnessed, that my only
chance of life was to try to play the <i>rôle</i> thus
forced upon me until an opportunity for escape
should present itself; so I tried hard to regain my
air of self-possession, which had been so rudely
shaken.</p>

<p>"I am indeed fatigued," I replied; "but I feel
stronger now. Excuse my momentary weakness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was but natural," said a man with a thick
beard at my right hand. "And now, most
honoured sir, how goes the cause in England?"</p>

<p>"Remarkably well," I answered.</p>

<p>"Has the great commissioner condescended to
send a missive to the Solteff branch?" asked
Petrokine.</p>

<p>"Nothing in writing," I replied.</p>

<p>"But he has spoken of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes: he said he had watched it with feelings
of the liveliest satisfaction," I returned.</p>

<p>"'Tis well! 'tis well!" ran round the table.</p>

<p>I felt giddy and sick from the critical nature of
my position. Any moment a question might be
asked which would show me in my true colours.
I rose and helped myself from a decanter of
brandy which stood on a side table. The potent
liquor flew to my excited brain, and as I sat
down I felt reckless enough to be half amused
at my position, and inclined to play with my
tormentors. I still, however, had all my wits
about me.</p>

<p>"You have been to Birmingham?" asked the
man with the beard.</p>

<p>"Many times," said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you have of course seen the private
workshop and arsenal?"</p>

<p>"I have been over them both more than once."</p>

<p>"It is still, I suppose, entirely unsuspected by
the police?" continued my interrogator.</p>

<p>"Entirely," I replied.</p>

<p>"Can you tell us how it is that so large a concern
is kept so completely secret?"</p>

<p>Here was a poser; but my native impudence
and the brandy seemed to come to my aid.</p>

<p>"That is information," I replied, "which I do
not feel justified in divulging even here. In withholding
it I am acting under the direction of the
chief commissioner."</p>

<p>"You are right&mdash;perfectly right," said my
original friend Petrokine. "You will no doubt
make your report to the central office at Moscow
before entering into such details."</p>

<p>"Exactly so," I replied, only too happy to get a
lift out of my difficulty.</p>

<p>"We have heard," said Alexis, "that you were
sent to inspect the <i>Livadia</i>. Can you give us any
particulars about it?"</p>

<p>"Anything you ask I will endeavour to answer,"
I replied, in desperation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have any orders been made in Birmingham
concerning it?"</p>

<p>"None when I left England."</p>

<p>"Well, well, there's plenty of time yet," said the
man with the beard&mdash;"many months. Will the
bottom be of wood or iron?"</p>

<p>"Of wood," I answered at random.</p>

<p>"'Tis well!" said another voice. "And what is
the breadth of the Clyde below Greenock?"</p>

<p>"It varies much," I replied; "on an average
about eighty yards."</p>

<p>"How many men does she carry?" asked an
anæmic-looking youth at the foot of the table, who
seemed more fit for a public school than this den
of murder.</p>

<p>"About three hundred," said I.</p>

<p>"A floating coffin!" said the young Nihilist, in
a sepulchral voice.</p>

<p>"Are the store-rooms on a level with or underneath
the state-cabins?" asked Petrokine.</p>

<p>"Underneath," said I decisively, though I need
hardly say I had not the smallest conception.</p>

<p>"And now, most honoured sir," said Alexis,
"tell us what was the reply of Bauer, the German
socialist, to Ravinsky's proclamation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was a deadlock with a vengeance.
Whether my cunning would have extricated me
from it or not was never decided, for Providence
hurried me from one dilemma into another and a
worse one.</p>

<p>A door slammed downstairs, and rapid footsteps
were heard approaching. Then came a loud tap
outside, followed by two smaller ones.</p>

<p>"The sign of the society!" said Petrokine; "and
yet we are all present; who can it be?"</p>

<p>The door was thrown open, and a man entered,
dusty and travel-stained, but with an air of authority
and power stamped on every feature of his harsh
but expressive face. He glanced round the table,
scanning each countenance carefully. There was a
start of surprise in the room. He was evidently a
stranger to them all.</p>

<p>"What means this intrusion, sir?" said my
friend with the beard.</p>

<p>"Intrusion!" said the stranger. "I was given
to understand that I was expected, and had looked
forward to a warmer welcome from my fellow-associates.
I am personally unknown to you,
gentlemen, but I am proud to think that my name
should command some respect among you. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Gustave Berger, the agent from England, bearing
letters from the chief commissioner to his well-beloved
brothers of Solteff."</p>

<p>One of their own bombs could hardly have
created greater surprise had it been fired in the
midst of them. Every eye was fixed alternately
on me and upon the newly-arrived agent.</p>

<p>"If you are indeed Gustave Berger," said
Petrokine, "who is this?"</p>

<p>"That I am Gustave Berger these credentials
will show," said the stranger, as he threw a packet
upon the table. "Who that man may be I know
not; but if he has intruded himself upon the lodge
under false pretences, it is clear that he must never
carry out of the room what he has learned. Speak,
sir," he added, addressing me: "who and what are
you?"</p>

<p>I felt that my time had come. My revolver was
in my hip-pocket; but what was that against so
many desperate men? I grasped the butt of it,
however, as a drowning man clings to a straw, and
I tried to preserve my coolness as I glanced round
at the cold, vindictive faces turned towards me.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," I said, "the <i>rôle</i> I have played
to-night has been a purely involuntary one on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
part. I am no police spy, as you seem to suspect;
nor, on the other hand, have I the honour to be a
member of your association. I am an inoffensive
corn-dealer, who by an extraordinary mistake has
been forced into this unpleasant and awkward
position."</p>

<p>I paused for a moment. Was it my fancy that
there was a peculiar noise in the street&mdash;a noise
as of many feet treading softly? No, it had
died away; it was but the throbbing of my own
heart.</p>

<p>"I need hardly say," I continued, "that anything
I may have heard to-night will be safe in my
keeping. I pledge my solemn honour as a
gentleman that not one word of it shall transpire
through me."</p>

<p>The senses of men in great physical danger
become strangely acute, or their imagination plays
them curious tricks. My back was towards the
door as I sat, but I could have sworn that I heard
heavy breathing behind it. Was it the three
minions whom I had seen before in the performance
of their hateful functions, and who, like
vultures, had sniffed another victim?</p>

<p>I looked round the table. Still the same hard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
cruel faces. Not one glance of sympathy. I
cocked the revolver in my pocket.</p>

<p>There was a painful silence, which was broken
by the harsh, grating voice of Petrokine.</p>

<p>"Promises are easily made and easily broken,"
he said. "There is but one way of securing eternal
silence. It is our lives or yours. Let the highest
among us speak."</p>

<p>"You are right, sir," said the English agent;
"there is but one course open. He must be
dismissed."</p>

<p>I knew what that meant in their confounded
jargon, and sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>"By Heaven," I shouted, putting my back
against the door, "you shan't butcher a free
Englishman like a sheep! The first among you
who stirs, drops!"</p>

<p>A man sprang at me. I saw along the sights of
my Derringer the gleam of a knife and the demoniacal
face of Gustave Berger. Then I pulled the
trigger, and, with his hoarse scream sounding in my
ears, I was felled to the ground by a crashing blow
from behind. Half unconscious, and pressed down
by some heavy weight, I heard the noise of shouts
and blows above me, and then I fainted away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>When I came to myself I was lying among the
<i>débris</i> of the door, which had been beaten in on the
top of me. Opposite were a dozen of the men who
had lately sat in judgment upon me, tied two and
two, and guarded by a score of Russian soldiers.
Beside me was the corpse of the ill-fated English
agent, the whole face blown in by the force of the
explosion. Alexis and Petrokine were both lying
on the floor like myself, bleeding profusely.</p>

<p>"Well, young fellow, you've had a narrow
escape," said a hearty voice in my ear.</p>

<p>I looked up, and recognised my black-eyed
acquaintance of the railway carriage.</p>

<p>"Stand up," he continued: "you're only a bit
stunned; no bones broken. It's no wonder I mistook
you for the Nihilist agent, when the very lodge
itself was taken in. Well, you're the only stranger
who ever came out of this den alive. Come downstairs
with me. I know who you are, and what
you are after now; I'll take you to Mr. Dimidoff.
Nay, don't go in there," he cried, as I walked
towards the door of the cell into which I had been
originally ushered. "Keep out of that: you've
seen evil sights enough for one day. Come down
and have a glass of liquor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>He explained as we walked back to the hotel
that the police of Solteff, of which he was the chief,
had had warning and been on the look-out during
some time for this Nihilist emissary. My arrival
in so unfrequented a place, coupled with my air
of secrecy and the English labels on that confounded
portmanteau of Gregory's, had completed
the business.</p>

<p>I have little more to tell. My Socialistic
acquaintances were all either transported to Siberia
or executed. My mission was performed to the
satisfaction of my employers. My conduct during
the whole business has won me promotion, and my
prospects for life have been improved since that
horrible night, the remembrance of which still
makes me shiver.</p>
